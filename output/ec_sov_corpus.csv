light agenda sustainable development document common guide next years history organization similar grand initiatives unfortunately remained confined paper idea years ago establishing new world economic order much hope similar fate befall current agenda yet fears exist main problem world lacks systemic stability means confidence come tomorrow confidence world evolving accordance rational order common sense wars conflicts increasing transnational challenges give rise feeling chaos chaos exists side side unprecedented interconnectedness scientific technological progress words living conditions contradictory realities chaos become serious contender positive globalization progress think three answers question — political economic social political point view problems arisen so-called winners cold war want integrate losers system furthermore case first world war victors tried impose vanquished unilaterally carry sweeping global changes affected everyone attempt unsuccessful could otherwise probably true history teach us something consequences attempt terrible — destruction states festering conflicts mega-terrorism large movements people form migration result terms politics world period transition however know moving towards must also consider economic factor context always conflict state market — least since time industrial revolution balanced healthy competition unquestionably useful economic progress reducing poverty inequality however recent decades balance disturbed market gained upper hand state relegated second place happened objective pursued so-called corporate capital dominated life leading developed countries free market given us minority — true advocate corporate capital — achieved even greater wealth everybody else corporate capital meant nothing suffering problems also important market seriously exacerbated environmental challenges world faces market concerned anything except profit market care environment problems social nature probably obvious general public time less serious less dangerous challenges face political economic spheres seeing growing social cultural gaps world problems identity loom large result spending time arguing essentially spiritual matters without question understandable reasons advent counterculture various countries half century ago also explanation phenomenon changed social relations west particularly areas morals moral values family however something makes sense changes affect rest world accepted changes impose others whose historical contexts different whose societies therefore reason adopt similar changes understanding reasons advent unstable world full contradictions certainly important first step towards action therefore change negative global context political terms clear understanding want go current period transition new world order endeavouring create course easier said done context help quote outstanding thinker immanuel kant said “ building peaceful international system difficult tasks perfect solution impossible ” ideas change world ideas different sacrifice something want enact change better result reflect lowest common denominator inevitable going try predict reality new world order terms form content would like focus attention three principles think essential building world order first new system state-driven states remain main players

one could restore rights stripped palestinians establish state based june borders east jerusalem capital furthermore regional interference arab affairs perpetrated mainly iran — country world constitution explicitly calls export revolution — aggravated conflicts region past years shown solutions based crisis management ineffective therefore joint international efforts must focus resolving crises conflicts — managing aware violence terrorism around us taken unprecedented forms relying heinous methods causing fear terror middle east also many countries worldwide demonstrates violence terrorism must longer associated single state region global threats recognize borders serious challenges facing region many countries require joint consideration ways address reach consensual timely effective solutions without undermining ongoing significant efforts regard countering terrorist groups right duty states however resorting laws ignore effective role played number states counter- terrorism would lead suffering many states respect recall so-called justice sponsors terrorism act united states america resulted arbitrary policies destabilization existing strong relationships among allies attempt present thoughts ways diagnose crises determine potential solutions example iraq suffering decade nearly daily acts sectarian violence iin addition part territory control terrorist groups thus spreading fear terror hearts iraqi people undermining region integrity moreover interference iran iraq internal affairs exacerbated divisiveness among iraqi people yet comprehensive political solution promote consensus among iraqi people put end marginalization whole sections iraqi society effective powers done regard prominent powers capable addressing serious crises done powers so-called super-powers simply tried minimize impact without resolving crisis approach merely made crises increasingly complex collapse state institutions emergence terrorism extremism thathasled high
