ethnic group beyond sights rapidly spreading every part world know famous american saying “ politics local ” militant islamists politics global ultimate goal dominate world threat might seem exaggerated since starts small like cancer attacks particular part body left unchecked cancer grows metastasizing wider wider areas protect peace security world must remove cancer late last week many countries represented rightly applauded president obama leading effort confront islamic state iraq sham isis yet weeks countries — countries support confronting isis — opposed israel confronting hamas evidently understand isis hamas branches poisonous tree isis hamas share fanatical creed seek impose well beyond territory control let us listen isis self-declared caliph abu bakr al-baghdadi said two months ago said day would soon come muslim would walk everywhere master muslims would cause world hear understand meaning terrorism destroy idol democracy let us listen khaled mashal leader hamas proclaims similar vision future “ say west ” says “ allah defeated tomorrow nation sit throne world ” charter makes clear hamas immediate goal destroy israel broader objective also wants caliphate hamas shares global ambitions fellow militant islamists supporters cheered wildly streets gaza thousands americans murdered leaders condemned united states killing osama bin laden praised holy warrior

militant islam power realize unbridled ambitions one place could soon happen — islamic state iran years iran relentlessly pursued global mission set forth founding ruler ayatollah khomeini following words “ export revolution entire world cry ‘ god allah echo throughout world ” ever since regime brutal enforcers iran revolutionary guards done exactly let us listen current commander general mohammad ali jafari clearly stated goal “ imam limit islamic revolution country duty prepare way islamic world government. ” iran president mr. rouhani stood last week shed crocodile tears called globalization terrorism maybe spare us phony tears word instead commanders iran revolutionary guards could ask call iran global terror campaign included attacks two dozen countries five continents since alone say iran practice terrorism like saying derek jeter never played shortstop new york yankees bemoaning iranian president spread terrorism got one history greatest displays double talk argue iran global terror campaign — subversion countries throughout middle east well beyond middle east — work extremists say things changing point last year election iran claim iran smooth-talking president foreign minister changed tone iran foreign policy also substance believe rouhani zarif generally want reconcile west abandoned global mission islamic revolution really let us look foreign minister zarif wrote book years ago “ fundamental problem west especially america heirs global mission tied raison être ” global mission tied reason zarif asks question — interesting question view
