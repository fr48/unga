brief would like speak today following three issues millennium development goals mdgs prospects realizing natural disasters humanitarian assistance war georgia russia along conclusions drawn let begin millennium development goals must bear mind half time originally allotted achieving goals already behind us yet actually reached half goals secretary-general ban ki-moon reported days ago reasons doubt achievements regarded noteworthy progress example greater access education marked reduction infant mortality debt relief developing countries increase access information communication technology people developing countries also made certain progress fight hiv/aids time however progress spheres trade development cooperation modest secretary-general report clear although donor states increased official development aid actual flow financial assistance course past two years actually decreased european union estonia member whole track towards increasing development aid per cent gross national income objective agreed united nations estonia steadily increased share among international donors development aid grown fourfold since addition actual decrease development aid suffered serious setback doha development round trade negotiations stalled main theme efficient integration developing countries world trading system based upon equality regulations would like set forth several positions based upon matters principle estonia regards essential also part united nations millennium declaration first every nation primarily responsible development order ensure proper development developing countries must strengthen administrative infrastructure capacity intensify fight corruption put economic environment order way create conditions suitable efficient mode transferring development aid increasing benefits aid received high levels corruption inefficient administrative capacity unresponsive economic climate make difficult donor-nation public opinion support increases development aid word electorates — course speaking democratic countries free fair elections — understand taxes spent way secondly donor states organizations enhance effectiveness development cooperation mutually coordinating standardizing procedures involved development cooperation finally would like stress estonia strongly supports british prime minister gordon brown secretary-general ban ki-moon initiative millennium development goals call action objective inform general public importance fulfilling objectives millennium development goals programme year estonia also joined initiative personally hope secretary-general ban ki-moon right said mdgs still achievable act second wednesday october international day natural disaster reduction connection opposed fight poverty diseases course set objectives expressed monetary amounts however formulate implement measures help minimize dangers threats people property avoid reduce destruction physical infrastructure environment thereby limit losses alleviate suffering people turn prevent social economic convulsions natural catastrophes repeated occasions triggered throughout history case humanitarian catastrophes natural man-made disasters utmost importance help arrive scene quickly possible access humanitarian experts ensured regardless nationality state organization represent unfortunately recently number occasions various countries permitted help abroad specific conditions result policies weakest vulnerable suffer said earlier would like talk recent ongoing events southern caucasus specifically military conflict georgia russia series complex issues involved general assembly would like raise one fundamental question events mean us united nations begin must realize principles governing relations states seriously damaged regrettable extreme basic principles united nations enshrined charter unacceptability threatening use force actual aggression nation territorial integrity grossly grotesquely violated principles must must remain bases activity united nations security council therefore right demand ensure united nations capable convincing one member withdraw military forces territory another sovereign member state terminate aggression capacity united nations fulfil expectations placed upon dependent upon whether said member nation chooses act according good practices international law alternative case united nations loses reason existence allow international law followed selectively convenient longer law russia behaviour weeks following cessation combat activity showed us unfortunately even first decade twenty- first century possible refuse adhere international treaties interpret arbitrarily observe international laws serves one interest permanent member security council especially committed fulfilling principles charter united nations forces us conclude interests international community imperative improve capacity united nations regulate resolve conflicts looking recent events become quite clear important proceed reform security council previous month events southern caucasus raised another issue even armed conflict broke georgia target cyberwar aimed government websites well news agencies banks case cyberattacks cyberwarfare becoming ever difficult determine apprehend perpetrators stated last year rostrum cyberattacks international problem — indeed form aggression — nation able deal cyberattacks launched nation continent continent administering policing cyberworld avoid criminal hostile attacks requires extensive cooperation standardization relevant international regulations call upon united nations member nations deal risks associated cybersecurity utmost seriousness estonia extensive experience dealing repulsing cyberattacks ready contribute expertise thwarting new form criminal warfare always inspiring come forum time observe many things unite rather divide nations around globe indeed united vision world free violence every individual freedom choice human dignity respected united aspirations meet challenges twenty-first century know globalized world threat one nation threat nations nowhere new reality evident much-needed work united nations poverty imbalances development armaments spread ideologies hatred cybercrime threats face today new daunting challenges different kind therefore individual states international community find ways deal new reality respond better new challenges seven years ago united nations conclave nations made historic step pledging eradicate poverty illiteracy environmental degradation improve health promote gender equality response challenges time year halfway deadline achieving millennium development goals mdgs past years estimated million people managed get extreme poverty significant positive changes taking place fields primary education poor children child vaccination better access retroviral treatment persons hiv/aids name yet overall progress achieving millennium development goals remains uneven slow want live commitments must increase efforts considerably urgently twenty-first century also confronted us challenges deteriorating environment global warming affects aspects lives social economic growth changing habitats migration patterns time clearly side taking measures adapt policies counter climate change actions obviously slow sometimes reluctant therefore lithuania welcomes secretary-general focus climate change global challenge requires global concerted efforts believe united nations climate change process appropriate forum negotiating future global action effort already may enough convinced world needs coherent inclusive system international environmental governance system needs strengthened establishing united nations environment organization based united nations environment programme unep revised mandate december bali climate change conference mind call countries come negotiating table later year ambition concluding global comprehensive agreement agreement reached lithuania best fulfil commitment european union achieve least per cent reduction greenhouse gas emissions compared

neighbours process various neighbourhood instruments cooperation formats however readiness stand speak openly states cross line also indispensable element effort ask fail killings hundreds thousands innocent people permitted take place darfur today conflicts occur every continent particularly grave consequences africa middle east conflicts world however less visible make less dangerous frozen
