    "On the international stage, there are two visions of the Internet: one that sees the Internet as open and free for all ideas, and the other that sees the Internet that should be restricted to within their boundaries, to restrict ideas only to \"approved\" ones. The United States and many other Western countries support the idea of an open Internet. Countries that prefer to restrict speech or monitor citizens, such as Russia and China, support what's called the \"sovereign\" Internet.\n",

    "*Digital Deciders* is a term used by New America (https://www.newamerica.org/cybersecurity-initiative/reports/digital-deciders/analyzing-the-clusters) to refer to countries that have not yet picked a side. We apply natural language processing tools on General Debate speeches made in the United Nations General Assembly from 1970 to 2018 to determine which worldview the Digital Deciders are more likely to lean towards."

    "## Part One: Creating the Corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "Before I can do any comparisons, I have to create the corpus of relevant speeches. At first, I began with cybersecurity-related terms, and then realized that doesn't make sense. Most countries who have made their position clear are the ones talking about security (to convince others). And the idea of voting with your friends means you are looking for other commonalities, such as economics and politics. So I created three different corpuses (corpi?) to try the analysis to see what is the most relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Looking for Relevant Speeches\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing I did was to use regexp and grep to look for cyber-related terms in files. The related terms for cybersecurity were: cyber, privacy, security, internet, and hack `[Cc]yber\\w+|[Pp]rivacy|[Ss]ecurity|[Ii]nternet|[Hh]ack`\n",
    "\n",
    "I then read in the files that contained the desired words and ran them through the TF/IDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second thing I did was to use regexp and grep to look for economics-related terms. This resulted in a much larger set of files. The related terms for economics were: economic, economy, market, debt, financial, invest, infrastructure, social, prosperity\n",
    "\n",
    "The third thing was to look for politics-related terms, which returned an even larger set of files. The related terms for politics were: sovereign, security, elections, democrat, government, allies, ally, co-operation, cooperation, stability\n",
    "\"peace and security\" and \"international security\""

       "['Mankind is increasingly feeling the winds\\nof the twenty-first century. What they bring depends on\\nall of us, on whether or not we succeed in responding\\ncollectively to new challenges and in establishing a\\nreliable system of international security and stability once\\nwe have overcome the vices, antagonisms and stereotypes\\naccumulated during the century about to end.\\nThis is not only possible, it is the imperative of our\\ntimes!\\nA well-known Russian proverb says, â€œIf you would\\nlive in the world, live in peaceâ€\\x9d. It contains a highly\\nphilosophical message of everlasting value. Mankind will\\nlive in peace and harmony once it has learned to resolve\\nemerging problems through peaceful, political means.\\nStates will live in peace and harmony once they have\\nrecognized their interrelationship and interdependence and\\nstarted to seek collective responses to the challenges of\\ntheir times.\\nExperience confirms the truth of this popular\\nwisdom. The most recent example is the sharp\\naggravation of the world monetary and financial crisis\\nwhich has besieged many countries, including Russia,\\nwhich is undergoing sweeping economic reforms. The\\ncurrent upheaval in the world financial markets can be\\novercome only by joint efforts that do not pursue\\nunilateral advantages and are intended to ensure global\\neconomic stability. Interaction of States in this process,\\nincluding within the framework of the United Nations,\\nmust, on principle, be raised to a new level.\\nAs for Russia, after overcoming an acute political\\ncrisis, the countryâs President, Boris N. Yeltsin, the\\nGovernment and the leading political forces are making\\nvigorous efforts to stabilize the economic and financial\\nsituation. This is not an easy task, but the solution will be\\nfound.\\nFrom this rostrum I pledge that Russia will not\\ndeviate from the path of reform and will do its best to\\npass with dignity this most difficult test, so as not only to\\npreserve the democratic progress that has been made but\\nalso to augment it.\\nLikewise, Russiaâs foreign policy will remain\\nconsistent and constructive. It is firmly geared towards\\nbuilding a democratic multipolar world, ensuring\\ninteraction with other States in the interests of settling\\ninternational problems by political means and developing\\nbroad, mutually beneficial cooperation in all areas.\\n20\\n\\n\\nWe are convinced that the problems before the world,\\nno matter how complex they may be, can be solved on the\\nbasis of strict observance of international law and close\\ninteraction among States. Multilateral organizations and\\nmechanisms have a special role to play in this respect.\\nAbove all, this applies to the United Nations, which\\ncontinues to be the sole universal international\\npeacekeeping organization and is thus better equipped than\\nany other world body to reach agreements on how to settle\\nconflicts, as well as to identify and remove the underlying\\nsocial and economic causes. It is important for United\\nNations efforts to be reinforced by support from regional\\norganizations.\\nWe highly value the level of interaction that now\\nexists between the United Nations and the Organization for\\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), acting as a\\nreliable partner in addressing complex European problems,\\nas well as interaction with the Organization of African\\nUnity (OAU) and other regional organizations, including\\nthe Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The\\ninternational community has developed a unique arsenal of\\npolitical and diplomatic tools intended for the resolution of\\nevery international problem. It must be put to effective use.\\nCoercive actions constitute exceptional methods of last\\nresort. Their use must be strictly regulated by the rules of\\ninternational law and above all by the United Nations\\nCharter. In other words, we advocate invoking the force of\\nlaw rather than the law of force in international affairs.\\nThe fact that the Iraqi crisis which erupted earlier this\\nyear was settled precisely by political means, through the\\njoint efforts of many States and the initiatives launched by\\nthe United Nations Secretary-General, provided graphic\\nevidence that the potential inherent in constructive and\\nactive diplomacy is by far more efficient than relying\\nexclusively on military force.\\nA new outbreak of tensions around Iraq has made us\\ndeeply concerned, since it is fraught with serious\\nconsequences for regional and international stability. No\\ndoubt Iraq must fully travel its part of the road, resume full\\ncooperation with the United Nations Special Commission\\nand the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and\\nimplement relevant Security Council resolutions. On the\\nother hand, the Security Council must adequately assess the\\nsituation related to the elimination of Iraqâs weapons of\\nmass destruction and answer the question of whether or not\\nthat country still poses a threat to regional and overall\\ninternational security after seven years of work carried out\\nthere by United Nations inspectors. Concerted action by the\\nworld community is required today to finally unblock this\\ncrisis situation.\\nPolitical logic must prevail over the logic of force in\\nour search for ways to settle the explosive conflict in\\nKosovo. The use of tools of coercion to resolve the\\nKosovo conflict might lead to a major war with\\nunpredictable consequences for the Balkan region and\\nEurope at large. It is our firm belief that a political\\nsolution is the only possible way of settling the problem\\nof Kosovo, granting it broad autonomy and ensuring strict\\nrespect for the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic\\nof Yugoslavia.\\nThe bloodshed in Afghanistan continues in spite of\\nthe fact that, as experience has shown, only temporary\\ngains can be obtained in that country through the use of\\narms. Rather, it is only through a persistent search for\\npolitical solutions, with the United Nations playing a\\ncentral role, that genuine stabilization, real settlement,\\nformation of an efficient central Government recognized\\nby all Afghans and, finally, assurance of Afghanistanâs\\nterritorial integrity and independence can realistically be\\naccomplished.\\nCollective political efforts are required to give a\\nsecond wind to the Middle East peace process. In our\\nview, it is not so much the absence of fresh ideas or\\nproposals but rather the upsetting of the balance that has\\nstymied progress on all the negotiating tracks. It should\\nnot be ignored that even if the Middle East process has\\nlong-term objectives, it also has its time limits. Russia has\\nconsistently advocated the establishment of an\\nindependent Palestinian State through political means and\\nnegotiations. It is only in this way that the inalienable\\nrights of the Palestinians to self-determination and reliable\\nassurance of Israelâs legitimate security interests can be\\nrealized.\\nIn a parallel move, talks must be resumed on the\\nSyrian and Lebanese tracks, building on the results\\nalready achieved.\\nThe recently proposed settlement of the Lockerbie\\ncase has been a major accomplishment of the international\\ncommunity. The adoption by the Security Council of a\\nrelevant resolution was possible due to the constructive\\napproach taken by the parties concerned â€” the United\\nStates, Great Britain, France and Libya â€” as well as due\\nto diplomatic efforts by many international organizations,\\nwhich were supported by Russia. It is essential to proceed\\nwithout delay to its implementation.\\n21\\n\\n\\nArguably, similar perseverance must be shown in the\\nefforts to break the deadlock in the Cyprus settlement. The\\nUnited Nations must play a leading role to this end.\\nFailure of the international community to fully\\nextinguish any one of the long-standing local conflicts in\\nAfrica in recent years is a source of growing concern.\\nMoreover, new flash points of tension have emerged on that\\ncontinent. It must be admitted that so far attempts to\\nachieve full coordination between the United Nations and\\nAfricaâs regional organizations have not succeeded. That is\\nwhy the upcoming Security Council ministerial meeting on\\nAfrica should focus on shaping a strong common stance\\ncapable of radically reversing the negative dynamics of\\nAfricaâs latest developments.\\nFor objective reasons, Russia has paid special attention\\nto settlement of conflict situations in the CIS. Whether in\\nAbkhazia, South Ossetia, Nagorno-Karabakh, Tajikistan or\\nTrans-Dniestria, our country has but one objective â€”\\nnamely, promoting a political settlement and helping build\\nlasting peace. As requested by the sides concerned, Russia\\nhas undertaken a difficult peace-building mission and is\\ndoing all it can to bring it to fruition. But the effort can\\nprove unavailing unless the parties in conflict show\\ngoodwill and a constructive attitude and also receive more\\nmeaningful international backing, above all from the United\\nNations and the OSCE.\\nWhile making strong efforts to settle regional crises,\\nwe should not lose sight of global problems, some of which\\nhave acquired a new dimension in the last year.\\nWe cannot but feel concerned over the emergence of\\na real threat in the form of the proliferation of nuclear\\nweapons throughout the planet. It is a common task of the\\ninternational community to encourage all countries to\\naccede both to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\\nNuclear Weapons and to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\\nBan Treaty. We welcome Brazilâs accession to the Non-\\nProliferation Treaty.\\nRussia is committed to the idea of continued reduction\\nof nuclear weapon arsenals and the maintenance of strategic\\nstability at lower armament levels. In this context, we\\nattach particularly great importance to the Russian-\\nAmerican interaction in the area of reducing strategic\\noffensive arms. In the course of his appointment hearings,\\nMr. Yevgeny M. Primakov, Chairman of the Russian\\nGovernment, expressed his firm resolve a few days ago to\\nseek early ratification by the State Duma of the START II\\nTreaty. Likewise, it is important for the United States to\\nratify all documents related to START II.\\nAccession of the other nuclear Powers to the nuclear\\narms control process is now on the agenda. We urge\\ncareful consideration of a proposal made by President\\nBoris Yeltsin that calls on the nuclear Powers to deploy\\nnuclear weapons exclusively within the boundaries of\\ntheir national territories. We note with satisfaction the\\nrecent consensus decision in the Conference on\\nDisarmament to start negotiations banning production of\\nnuclear-weapon-grade fissionable materials. What is of\\nspecial significance is that the decision was supported by\\nStates that are not yet parties to the Treaty on the Non-\\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, among others. We are\\nconvinced that such a ban would be a further necessary\\nstep in multilateral efforts to enhance the non-proliferation\\nregime and nuclear disarmament.\\nThe nuclear threat has many faces. Today, nuclear\\nterrorism can also be a source of that threat. What seemed\\nto be science fiction yesterday can now, much to our\\nregret, become a reality. Hence, strong action by the\\ninternational community is required to prevent the real-\\nlife emergence of that new form of terrorism.\\nAccelerating work on a draft convention to combat acts\\nof nuclear terrorism, submitted by our country so that it\\ncan be adopted by the General Assembly at the current\\nsession, has become particularly relevant.\\nRussia has repeatedly stated at the highest level its\\nfirm opposition to terrorism in all its forms and\\nmanifestations. International terrorism is one of the most\\ndangerous global challenges to international stability. It\\ncan be successfully combated only through united action\\nby all States. Indeed, only by acting together instead of\\nmaking unilateral power moves, shall we be able to\\nsucceed in our fight against that most dangerous of evils.\\nMilitant separatism has become another factor that\\ndestabilizes international relations. Relying exclusively on\\nextremist methods in the struggle for the national rights\\nof minority groups within multinational States, separatism\\noften finds itself in league with terrorism and religious\\nfanaticism. Separatism inevitably provokes internal\\nconflicts in which neighbouring countries frequently get\\ninvolved, thereby setting the stage for stoking regional\\ncrises.\\nMore than two and a half thousand national\\nminorities live in 150 countries of the world. Were all of\\nthem to aspire to a State entity of their own, the\\ndisastrous and catastrophic consequences could easily be\\nimagined. Those who foment separatism should keep that\\nin mind.\\n22\\n\\n\\nThe fight against drugs also requires joint, concerted\\naction. We must focus on the practical implementation of\\nthe relevant decisions aimed at combating the drug threat\\nadopted by the General Assembly at its special session.\\nThe international community should take a common\\nstand in implementing the provisions of the Universal\\nDeclaration of Human Rights, whose fiftieth anniversary\\noccurs this year. In this area, too, resolute joint action is\\nneeded in respect of those States which, under various\\npretexts, violate generally recognized human rights and\\nfreedoms. There can be no tolerance of double standards\\ninvolving attempts to shield those who elevate to the level\\nof Government policy discrimination against a part of the\\npopulation. Russia cannot and will not remain indifferent to\\nthe fate of hundreds of thousands of Russian-speaking\\ncitizens subjected to harsh repressive measures in Latvia\\nand Estonia. The international community, and above all the\\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,\\nshould closely watch the situation in those countries.\\nI have touched upon a few of the important issues\\nwhich the United Nations is called upon to deal with at this\\ntime. It continues to play its unique role as facilitator of\\njoint efforts by States to strengthen peace and security, deal\\nwith urgent issues and meet new global challenges. To that\\nend, it is necessary to improve United Nations mechanisms\\nand adapt them to todayâs needs. That is exactly what the\\nprocess of reforming the United Nations, launched by\\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, seeks to accomplish. The\\nrationale behind it is enhanced efficiency for the\\nOrganization.\\nThat is the angle from which we approach the ongoing\\ndiscussion on the work of the Security Council. No one\\nshould question the Security Councilâs primary\\nresponsibility under the Charter for the maintenance of\\npeace and security. It is extremely important to preserve its\\neffectiveness and its efficiency in decision-making, as well\\nas to build on internal cohesion and work coordination\\nmethods developed in recent years.\\nI should like to reaffirm that we support the\\nimplementation of reforms and changes in United Nations\\nmechanisms that will promote effective consolidation of the\\nUnited Nations and improve its activities. Among the steps\\ntaken to that end I wish to mention adoption, under United\\nNations auspices, of the Statute of the International\\nCriminal Court. Russiaâs initiative to launch a discussion on\\nways to achieve international information security serves\\nthe same goal. In essence, our proposal is intended to offset\\nthreats inherent in the use of the latest advances in science\\nand technology for purposes incompatible with the\\nmaintenance of international security.\\nI wish to single out a dangerous tendency: that of\\nadapting the United Nations to meet the requirements of\\nan individual State, or of replacing it altogether as, for\\nexample, in the case of peacekeeping. What I have in\\nmind are attempts to undercut the powers of the Security\\nCouncil, as laid down in the Charter, to use coercive\\nmeasures. We must not allow a precedent to be created\\ninvolving the use of military potential in a crisis situation\\nwithout the consent of the Security Council. Surely it is\\nobvious that such actions could lead to a serious erosion\\nof the existing system of international relations, whose\\ncentral element is the United Nations.\\nUnited Nations sanctions as an instrument of\\ninternational coercion also require a highly balanced\\napproach. When introduced by the Security Council,\\nsanctions should not become a tool to fight a regime that\\nmay be disliked. Sanctions should not make people suffer.\\nThey should not destabilize the economic situation in the\\ncountry subjected to sanctions or in the adjacent region.\\nIt is time to fine-tune the mechanism regulating the\\nimposition of sanctions and their duration and the\\nprocedures for easing and lifting them.\\nIn short, individual elements of the United Nations\\nmechanism need improvement and retooling. But we\\nshould go about it with a full sense of responsibility,\\nmindful of the medical professionâs rule that unnecessary\\nharm is to be avoided at all costs.\\nEvery session of the General Assembly is, in a way,\\na milestone event. Each session is expected to make a\\ntangible contribution to the resolution of acute problems\\nconfronting mankind.

       "['\\ufeff212.\\tThe opportunity we have at this time to address this illustrious Assembly of the United Nations—the symbol for all the peoples represented here of hope for a future marked by harmony, respect, equality and co-operation among nations—enables us to express cur satisfaction at noting that some progress has been made towards such a future despite the fact that these objectives are still far from being embodied in international practice.\\n213.\\tWe wish to share in the responsibility, incumbent upon us all, of debating in this forum the topics that we\\nbelieve to be fundamental for the progress of mankind. Collective security, peace and development are topics which concern all peoples in this world in which interdependence is becoming an increasingly clear reality. It is with pleasure that we note the consolidation of the principles for which we have always fought and the increasing acceptance of the\\n\\naspirations and legitimate demands of the countries of the third world for a greater and more equal participation in the resolution of the problems that trouble us all.\\n214.\\tIt is in this framework of a progressive and salutary democratization of international relations that we greet the admission of Solomon Islands as the one hundred and fiftieth Member of the United Nations and at the same time we wish its people and Government, as they begin to enjoy the natural euphoria of freedom and the responsibility of an independent life, great success on the long road of progress and development.\\n215.\\tMr. President, your recognized qualities as a statesman and a diplomat experienced in international affairs convince us that the work of this session will be directed with all the skill required by the complexities of the problems we are going to discuss.\\n216.\\tWe should also like to pay a tribute to the outgoing President, the representative of a country which for many decades has given an example of a consistent policy in defence of international legality. We must recognize that Mr. Mojsov guaranteed the success of the thirty-second session of this Assembly.\\n217.\\tIt would be no more than simple justice to take advantage of our presence in this Assembly to draw attention to the tireless and skilful work of the Secretary- General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, who, by his consistent activity in the service of international peace and security and healthy co-operation among nations, has contributed undeniably to the strengthening of the credibility and effectiveness of our world Organization. Therefore we wish to offer to Mr. Waldheim all our support in his efforts to give concrete form to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and we reiterate our constant readiness to take part in joint action by nations in favour of the freedom, independence, development and the well- being of peoples.\\n218.\\tWe have just left a world in which a fierce struggle was necessary to gain recognition of the rights of peoples to be independent and to choose the ways they consider most suitable for their development.\\n219.\\tWe are the beneficiaries of this new legality which allows us to believe in the possibility of increasingly peaceful coexistence among countries at different levels of development and with different social structures. We are the beneficiaries of this struggle, which has been our struggle too for a very long time, since it can be asserted that our diplomatic history began, like that of Guinea- Bissau, at the moment when the PAIGC  began the struggle for the independence of our peoples. However, our struggle in fact was merely a concrete expression of the principles which have been reiterated year after year in this Assembly and which are embodied in all the fundamental documents of this Organization.\\n220.\\tWe believe that we have contributed by our efforts to the effective recognition of these principles, which constitute the basis of the international law of our time.\\n221.\\tThe geographical situation of my country, at the crossroad? of peoples and continents, constitutes one of its advantages. This position has always enabled Cape Verde to play an important role in bringing peoples together, which is perfectly in keeping with the guiding principles of our policy of non-alignment.\\n222.\\tThus we reaffirm that the Republic of Cape Verde will never shelter foreign military bases or serve as a liaison or support centre for aggressive operations against sovereign peoples and States.\\n223.\\tWe believe that peace, the necessary condition for development, will become a reality only when the rules established by all are implemented by all and guide the daily relations among nations. That is how we view our participation in the international community.\\n224.\\tThis Assembly, as in the past, continues to be a forum for repeated condemnation of attempts to perpetuate in Africa anachronistic situations marked by colonial and racist domination and apartheid. The praiseworthy and patient efforts of the international community, an echo of the liberation struggle of the peoples of Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa, which are reflected in the many resolutions of the United Nations condemning the minority regimes of southern Africa, have merely prompted the intensification of the terror inflicted on defenceless populations, the aggression against independent African States, the absolute lack of respect for and permanent defiance of the international community and the desire of the peoples of southern Africa for a life of dignity and peace. The indisputable evidence of this defiance of our world Organization is the recent decision of the South African Government to proceed unilaterally with a process leading to elections in Namibia which will inevitably be falsified, deliberately and dangerously disregarding the legitimate claims of the people of Namibia and its authentic representative, SWAPO, and flouting with barefaced arrogance every initiative aiming at a peaceful transition to independence.\\n225.\\tWe have always been convinced that the racist and apartheid regimes, since they are working against the tide of history, have never been ready to accept dialogue or to abandon the savage methods by which they trample underfoot the most fundamental human rights and resort systematically to violence against sovereign peoples and States, and this conviction has been reiterated year after year in this Assembly. Recent events persuade us that it is necessary and urgent that the international community multiply, diversify and centralize its efforts to assist SWAPO, the liberation movement fighting for the national independence and the territorial integrity of Namibia.\\n226.\\tThe people of Zimbabwe today are compelled to try to deal with a new farce: those who practise colonial oppression and defend apartheid have now taken up the banner of majority power and are claiming to lead the process for the transfer of power to the majority, oblivious of the freedom fighters united in the Patriotic Front. The kind of solution that neglects the profound aspirations of the people of Zimbabwe to genuine independence amounts to nothing but ad hoc concessions to the pressure brought to bear by the liberation struggle, which, we solemnly reaffirm, deserves our complete solidarity.\\n227.\\tIn 1975, when welcoming the independence of Mozambique and Angola, we welcomed at the same time the emergence of a different stage in the struggle of the people of southern Africa. The buffer States disappeared and were replaced by two independent countries, strengthened by the example they gave to others and determined not to accept the situation prevailing south of their borders.\\n228.\\tThe growing isolation of that bastion of colonialism—to which the efforts made in the United Nations have contributed significantly and were certainly consolidated by the decisions of the recent World Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination and the heroic resistance of the people of South Africa, led by their liberation movements, are driving the regime to exasperation, and, becoming even more defiant, it is systematically committing aggression with impunity against neighbouring countries.\\n229.\\tWe pay a tribute to those true interpreters of noble objectives who presided over the creation of the highest international body. It is the duty of the international community throughout the International Anti-Apartheid Year and the\\' Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination to try to find effective ways of further isolating the anachronistic Pretoria regime and wiping out the historic shame of apartheid. Experience shows that this requires the strengthening of the capacity for action of the liberation movements.\\n230.\\tIn keeping with our experience of the national liberation struggle and as a country recently liberated from colonial oppression after two long decades of political and armed struggle, we understand the true dimensions of the immeasurable suffering imposed on the people of the Western Sahara in its struggle for the liberation of that Territory, which is illegally occupied and divided. Our solidarity with the peoples struggling against all kinds of oppression and opposition to the exercise of their right to self-determination and independence in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) reinforces our conviction that the dispute between the Saharan people and those who occupy its national territory can be peacefully and justly resolved only by the effective exercise by that people of their right to determine their own destiny in sovereignty and freedom.\\n231.\\tIn the same way, we stand shoulder to shoulder with the peoples of East Timor who are fighting for the total realization of their desire for freedom and independence.\\n232.\\tIn the Middle East, a situation persists which defies the general feeling of the international community, which has been clearly, repeatedly and unambiguously expressed in this Assembly and in other bodies of our Organization. The persistence in a policy of aggression, occupation and expansion, accompanied by attempts to transform demographic, economic, cultural and religious structures of regions conquered by force, represents a flagrant violation of the principles of the United Nations and furthermore constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security.\\n233.\\tSince our country is one of the youngest Members of this great family of sovereign and independent nations, and since we received from the United Nations considerable support during our national liberation struggle and even after independence, we are accustomed to viewing the Organization as the main guarantor or\\' international legality and the defender of the just claims of peoples for a life of peace, justice and progress.\\n234.\\tAs stubborn defenders of the ideals of the United Nations, of the movements of the non-aligned countries and of the OAU, we note with great concern the acts of aggression committed against Lebanon and the frequent violations of its territorial integrity and sovereignty. All States of the region are entitled to live in peace, independence and security. But a just and lasting peace will never be achieved until Israel decides to withdraw completely from all the Arab territory which it has occupied since 1967 and until it recognizes the legitimate, permanent and inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people and agrees to the effective exercise of those rights, including the right to establish a national and independent State.\\n235.\\tWe should like to reaffirm our unstinting support of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole legitimate representative of that martyred people, and our conviction that a definitive solution of the problem of the Middle East cannot be found without the active participation of the freedom fighters of the Palestine Liberation Organization on a footing of equality with all other parties directly involved in the conflict. Meanwhile we are following with keen interest the continuing efforts that are being made to try to establish suitable conditions for negotiations which, while respecting the basic and inalienable claims of the Palestinian people, would point the way to a peaceful and just solution.\\n236.\\tAs we commemorate this year the thirtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we should like to take this opportunity to express our satisfaction at the positive role which the United Nations has played in the field of human rights. Indeed, the establishment of norms of international law in this connexion, the consecration of the right of peoples to self-determination and independence, and the initiatives taken in the field of the struggle against discrimination, racism, apartheid, torture and crimes against peace and humanity, as well as the special attention accorded to cases of the flagrant violation of human rights, are results of unquestionable importance to the credit of United Nations activity in this field, and it is a pleasure for me to emphasize them here.\\n237.\\tThe Republic of Cape Verde, the fruit of a genuine battle for human rights consisting in the long and hard political and armed struggle successfully carried out by PAIGC against Portuguese colonialism, can only rejoice at the visibly positive balance-sheet of the activities of our world Organization on behalf of human rights and freedoms.\\n238.\\tAfter independence a new administration was set up in our country based on broad popular participation, which is being restructured and consolidated and which is dedicated to guaranteeing to all citizens fundamental political and civil rights and freedoms. However, we feel that the struggle is continuing beyond the time of national independence, because the question of human rights cannot be dissociated from the economic, social and cultural context. Indeed, the effective, total and conscious exercise of civil and political rights is practically impossible without the establishment of certain basic economic, social and cultural conditions. There is consequently an essential interdependence of fundamental human rights which cannot be ignored.\\n239.\\tThe struggle for human rights is therefore in our country a process that is still continuing. Internally we are establishing the basis for economic development without which it would be impossible to free man from the spectre of hunger, poverty, disease, ignorance and illiteracy.\\n240.\\tOn the other hand, the question of human rights goes beyond the purely national sphere and is closely tied to certain questions of an international nature which are among the most important of our time. The effective exercise of human rights is not possible while the present international order persists and while colonialism, racism, apartheid and foreign domination and occupation prevail. However, the extension to the international level of problems of human rights must not make legitimate their use as a means of pressure, which might give rise to a climate of tension in relations between States.\\n241.\\tWe think that the United Nations should continue to play an important role in the promotion and safeguarding of human rights through the organs that it has set up, whose possibilities have not yet been exhausted and whose effectiveness has already been demonstrated on several occasions.\\n242.\\tWe should also like to express\\' our solidarity with those who deplore the incongruity of the fact that in a world where the spectre of hunger afflicts millions of human beings, nations continue year after year to spend enormous sums of money on the manufacture and stockpiling of arms. It is also to be deplored that an increasing part of the trade between nations is made up of the buying and selling of military equipment, while a large part of the population of the world remains without support in its struggle for the protection of the environment and the production of food and against ignorance, disease and natural disasters.\\n243.\\tThe continuance of a system where peace is merely the result of the permanent fear of reciprocal destruction cannot but contribute to increase tension in international relations and to divert States from their main task, which is to guarantee the well-being of their peoples. The need to put an end to the arms race and to initiate a procedure that will lead to real disarmament is felt very deeply by the whole of the international community. In this process at different regional levels great progress has been made, and laudable initiatives have been taken for the conclusion of agreements on the limitation of strategic weapons and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. In this process the United Nations, as the sole body capable of giving a universal dimension to the struggle for peace, security and development, should play an important role.\\n244.\\tThe fruitful results of this kind of thinking have already been confirmed by the tenth special session of the\\nGeneral. Assembly devoted to disarmament, convened in accordance with an initiative of the non-aligned countries.\\n245.\\tWe hope that the United Nations Disarmament Commission will be in a position to ensure the implementation of the decisions taken at that special session and to provide elements for a global programme of disarmament . At the same time we welcome the creation of the Committee on Disarmament, a body in which the nuclear Powers and a number of countries including many non-aligned countries will participate on an equal footing.\\n246.\\tIt is a fact that the existence of large stocks of weapons, particularly of non-conventional weapons, is a constant threat to the survival of all mankind.\\n247.\\tIn such conditions we think that through the United Nations all countries will be able to participate actively in\\nthe creation of a lasting policy for international security.\\n\\n248.\\tInternational economic relations are still hampered by the contradictions that arise from the imbalance that exists today between the rich and industrialized countries on the one hand and the poor underdeveloped countries on the other.\\n249.\\tIt is that system of international economic relations, the mechanisms of which contribute to the accentuation of this imbalance and hinder efforts towards development, which has been and continues to be the subject of debate in the United Nations, particularly, in the sixth and seventh special sessions of this Assembly.\\n250.\\tIn this context we are witnessing a growing awareness of the need to create a new order with values that will govern international economic relations. The various sessions of UNCTAD, the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries, held at Buenos Aires, and the agreements between the African, Caribbean and Pacific group and the European Economic Community, among others, are examples of such concern.\\n251.\\tThe pursuit of this objective, we must admit, has met with obstacles which give rise to doubts and questionings and might make a really constructive dialogue more difficult to achieve. The existing monetary disturbances, the growing monetary erosion, in particular in countries with relatively weak economies, the deterioration in the terms of trade between countries supplying raw materials and industrialized countries, together with the protectionism practised by certain countries, justify our concern.\\n\\n252.\\tWe are at a stage in the history of mankind when the existing basis of the international economic order is being questioned and it is our great responsibility to reflect on and consider the principles which should govern future international economic relations.\\n253.\\tIn our opinion the creation of a new international economic order should comprise: first, the recognition of the objective needed to alter the existing economic order and to achieve the participation of all countries on an equal footing in the solution of the problems which afflict mankind, and, with that recognition, the political will to give it effect; secondly, an increase in the technical and technological capacity of the developing countries, to enable them thus to benefit from the achievements of science and technology; thirdly, financial assistance in order . attain at least the objective of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product as established by the United Nations; fourthly, special assistance to the least developed among the developing countries, which, besides suffering the injustice of the present system have to confront naturally unfavourable conditions; and fifthly, effective support for the Buenos Aires Programme of Action on technical co-operation among developing countries.\\n254.\\tWe are convinced that the United Nations has a considerable role to play in the realization of the objectives that we have mentioned.\\n255.\\tWe \"expect, moreover, the constructive co-operation of members of the Committee of the Whole so that that Committee may fully exercise the functions which we consider to be extremely important in defining the new international economic order.\\n256.\\tWe are an island country, a small territory with limited natural resources, and consequently we attach particular importance to questions concerning the appropriation and distribution of maritime resources and, generally, to all problems relating to the law of the sea. When in December 1970 General Assembly resolution 2749 (XXV) was adopted, it was welcomed as an invaluable instrument for the definition of a new international economic order and as a legitimate expression of the hope of countries which, like our own, do not have the necessary technological means successfully to exploit the resources of the sea-bed on their own.\\n257.\\tHowever, the results of the latest session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea have cast a shadow on the promising prospects that had opened in the course of continuing negotiations towards a definition of international law in that field. Indeed, at that session we heard talk of unilateral legislation, an idea which, if maintained, would run counter to the positions previously adopted by the international community.\\n258.\\tWe are certain that an understanding of the importance of a successful conclusion of the work of that Conference will ensure that our efforts will not end in a failure which would seriously affect international relations.\\n259.\\tIn Cape Verde we are now totally involved in the struggle for national reconstruction, a struggle that is particularly difficult if one considers the chaotic situation which we inherited.\\n260.\\tWe are reduced to constituting, almost inch by inch, the land that we shall have to work, to creating out of nothing the conditions for the survival of our people and to building the structures of a democratic State on what was left us by the ruinous inertia of a colonial Power.\\n261.\\tWe have to waste a great deal of energy and effort to reverse the situation of impoverishment created in our country by centuries of neglect. Desertification, emigration and social imbalance are still the deep-rooted signs of the system which we fought and abolished.\\n262.\\tThe United Nations, which has always supported and been able to channel and stimulate international solidarity with our people, will evaluate during this session the report prepared by the United Nations mission which, in pursuance of resolution 32/99 [A/331167 and Corr. l], recently visited our country.\\n263.\\tWe should like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to all those who have given our country timely and much-needed assistance. We are certain that, duly enlightened by this document, the United Nations and the donor countries will then be in a position to increase their co-operation with our country. That co-operation continues to be an invaluable aid in the solution of the many very urgent problems which we face and is a significant contribution to the establishment of suitable infrastructures for the economic and social development of Cape Verde.\\n264.\\tBefore concluding, we wish to express our ever growing confidence in the activities and the future of the United Nations which, while consolidating year by year both its prestige and its representativeness with the admission of a growing number of States, is also making praiseworthy efforts to improve its structure and inculcate new dynamism into its bodies in order to be able to resolve the many serious and complex problems that afflict mankind.\\n265.\\tWe are convinced that the United Nations provides the appropriate and privileged forum in which to find solutions which will meet the fundamental concerns of our time, and in which the nations which emerge in future from the struggle legitimized by the noble purposes which inspire this Organization will be heard.\\n266.\\tAs the head of the Government of the Republic of . Cape Verde, I wish to reaffirm our support for the principles which have always guided our actions, in particular those of the non-alignment, self-determination and independence of peoples, respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, mutual respect, reciprocal advantage and peaceful coexistence among all the peoples of the world.\\n267.\\tWe sincerely hope that the work of this session will constitute a step towards the consolidation of the progress already made in the building of a future which promises freedom and happiness for all people, and will lead to the progress that we all so earnestly desire.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n']"

       "['\\ufeff212.\\tThe opportunity we have at this time to address this illustrious Assembly of the United Nations—the symbol for all the peoples represented here of hope for a future marked by harmony, respect, equality and co-operation among nations—enables us to express cur satisfaction at noting that some progress has been made towards such a future despite the fact that these objectives are still far from being embodied in international practice.\\n213.\\tWe wish to share in the responsibility, incumbent upon us all, of debating in this forum the topics that we\\nbelieve to be fundamental for the progress of mankind. Collective security, peace and development are topics which concern all peoples in this world in which interdependence is becoming an increasingly clear reality. It is with pleasure that we note the consolidation of the principles for which we have always fought and the increasing acceptance of the\\n\\naspirations and legitimate demands of the countries of the third world for a greater and more equal participation in the resolution of the problems that trouble us all.\\n214.\\tIt is in this framework of a progressive and salutary democratization of international relations that we greet the admission of Solomon Islands as the one hundred and fiftieth Member of the United Nations and at the same time we wish its people and Government, as they begin to enjoy the natural euphoria of freedom and the responsibility of an independent life, great success on the long road of progress and development.\\n215.\\tMr. President, your recognized qualities as a statesman and a diplomat experienced in international affairs convince us that the work of this session will be directed with all the skill required by the complexities of the problems we are going to discuss.\\n216.\\tWe should also like to pay a tribute to the outgoing President, the representative of a country which for many decades has given an example of a consistent policy in defence of international legality. We must recognize that Mr. Mojsov guaranteed the success of the thirty-second session of this Assembly.\\n217.\\tIt would be no more than simple justice to take advantage of our presence in this Assembly to draw attention to the tireless and skilful work of the Secretary- General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, who, by his consistent activity in the service of international peace and security and healthy co-operation among nations, has contributed undeniably to the strengthening of the credibility and effectiveness of our world Organization. Therefore we wish to offer to Mr. Waldheim all our support in his efforts to give concrete form to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and we reiterate our constant readiness to take part in joint action by nations in favour of the freedom, independence, development and the well- being of peoples.\\n218.\\tWe have just left a world in which a fierce struggle was necessary to gain recognition of the rights of peoples to be independent and to choose the ways they consider most suitable for their development.\\n219.\\tWe are the beneficiaries of this new legality which allows us to believe in the possibility of increasingly peaceful coexistence among countries at different levels of development and with different social structures. We are the beneficiaries of this struggle, which has been our struggle too for a very long time, since it can be asserted that our diplomatic history began, like that of Guinea- Bissau, at the moment when the PAIGC  began the struggle for the independence of our peoples. However, our struggle in fact was merely a concrete expression of the principles which have been reiterated year after year in this Assembly and which are embodied in all the fundamental documents of this Organization.\\n220.\\tWe believe that we have contributed by our efforts to the effective recognition of these principles, which constitute the basis of the international law of our time.\\n221.\\tThe geographical situation of my country, at the crossroad? of peoples and continents, constitutes one of its advantages. This position has always enabled Cape Verde to play an important role in bringing peoples together, which is perfectly in keeping with the guiding principles of our policy of non-alignment.\\n222.\\tThus we reaffirm that the Republic of Cape Verde will never shelter foreign military bases or serve as a liaison or support centre for aggressive operations against sovereign peoples and States.\\n223.\\tWe believe that peace, the necessary condition for development, will become a reality only when the rules established by all are implemented by all and guide the daily relations among nations. That is how we view our participation in the international community.\\n224.\\tThis Assembly, as in the past, continues to be a forum for repeated condemnation of attempts to perpetuate in Africa anachronistic situations marked by colonial and racist domination and apartheid. The praiseworthy and patient efforts of the international community, an echo of the liberation struggle of the peoples of Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa, which are reflected in the many resolutions of the United Nations condemning the minority regimes of southern Africa, have merely prompted the intensification of the terror inflicted on defenceless populations, the aggression against independent African States, the absolute lack of respect for and permanent defiance of the international community and the desire of the peoples of southern Africa for a life of dignity and peace. The indisputable evidence of this defiance of our world Organization is the recent decision of the South African Government to proceed unilaterally with a process leading to elections in Namibia which will inevitably be falsified, deliberately and dangerously disregarding the legitimate claims of the people of Namibia and its authentic representative, SWAPO, and flouting with barefaced arrogance every initiative aiming at a peaceful transition to independence.\\n225.\\tWe have always been convinced that the racist and apartheid regimes, since they are working against the tide of history, have never been ready to accept dialogue or to abandon the savage methods by which they trample underfoot the most fundamental human rights and resort systematically to violence against sovereign peoples and States, and this conviction has been reiterated year after year in this Assembly. Recent events persuade us that it is necessary and urgent that the international community multiply, diversify and centralize its efforts to assist SWAPO, the liberation movement fighting for the national independence and the territorial integrity of Namibia.\\n226.\\tThe people of Zimbabwe today are compelled to try to deal with a new farce: those who practise colonial oppression and defend apartheid have now taken up the banner of majority power and are claiming to lead the process for the transfer of power to the majority, oblivious of the freedom fighters united in the Patriotic Front. The kind of solution that neglects the profound aspirations of the people of Zimbabwe to genuine independence amounts to nothing but ad hoc concessions to the pressure brought to bear by the liberation struggle, which, we solemnly reaffirm, deserves our complete solidarity.\\n227.\\tIn 1975, when welcoming the independence of Mozambique and Angola, we welcomed at the same time the emergence of a different stage in the struggle of the people of southern Africa. The buffer States disappeared and were replaced by two independent countries, strengthened by the example they gave to others and determined not to accept the situation prevailing south of their borders.\\n228.\\tThe growing isolation of that bastion of colonialism—to which the efforts made in the United Nations have contributed significantly and were certainly consolidated by the decisions of the recent World Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination and the heroic resistance of the people of South Africa, led by their liberation movements, are driving the regime to exasperation, and, becoming even more defiant, it is systematically committing aggression with impunity against neighbouring countries.\\n229.\\tWe pay a tribute to those true interpreters of noble objectives who presided over the creation of the highest international body. It is the duty of the international community throughout the International Anti-Apartheid Year and the\\' Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination to try to find effective ways of further isolating the anachronistic Pretoria regime and wiping out the historic shame of apartheid. Experience shows that this requires the strengthening of the capacity for action of the liberation movements.\\n230.\\tIn keeping with our experience of the national liberation struggle and as a country recently liberated from colonial oppression after two long decades of political and armed struggle, we understand the true dimensions of the immeasurable suffering imposed on the people of the Western Sahara in its struggle for the liberation of that Territory, which is illegally occupied and divided. Our solidarity with the peoples struggling against all kinds of oppression and opposition to the exercise of their right to self-determination and independence in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) reinforces our conviction that the dispute between the Saharan people and those who occupy its national territory can be peacefully and justly resolved only by the effective exercise by that people of their right to determine their own destiny in sovereignty and freedom.\\n231.\\tIn the same way, we stand shoulder to shoulder with the peoples of East Timor who are fighting for the total realization of their desire for freedom and independence.\\n232.\\tIn the Middle East, a situation persists which defies the general feeling of the international community, which has been clearly, repeatedly and unambiguously expressed in this Assembly and in other bodies of our Organization.

That co-operation continues to be an invaluable aid in the solution of the many very urgent problems which we face and is a significant contribution to the establishment of suitable infrastructures for the economic and social development of Cape Verde.\\n264.\\tBefore concluding, we wish to express our ever growing confidence in the activities and the future of the United Nations which, while consolidating year by year both its prestige and its representativeness with the admission of a growing number of States, is also making praiseworthy efforts to improve its structure and inculcate new dynamism into its bodies in order to be able to resolve the many serious and complex problems that afflict mankind.\\n265.\\tWe are convinced that the United Nations provides the appropriate and privileged forum in which to find solutions which will meet the fundamental concerns of our time, and in which the nations which emerge in future from the struggle legitimized by the noble purposes which inspire this Organization will be heard.\\n266.\\tAs the head of the Government of the Republic of . Cape Verde, I wish to reaffirm our support for the principles which have always guided our actions, in particular those of the non-alignment, self-determination and independence of peoples, respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, mutual respect, reciprocal advantage and peaceful coexistence among all the peoples of the world.\\n267.\\tWe sincerely hope that the work of this session will constitute a step towards the consolidation of the progress already made in the building of a future which promises freedom and happiness for all people, and will lead to the progress that we all so earnestly desire.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n']"

       "['The statements delivered during this session’s general debate confirm that international relations are now being conducted in a complex and controversial period of history.\\nToday, we are all witnessing two opposing trends collide. On the one hand, we  see the strengthening    of polycentric principles of world order, the steady development of new centres of economic growth and peoples’ aspirations to preserve their sovereignty and choose development models that are consistent with their national, cultural and religious identities. On the other hand, we see the desire of a number of Western States to retain their self-proclaimed status as world leaders and slow the irreversible and objective process of establishing multipolarity. To that  end,  they  do not hesitate to use every possible method, including political blackmail, economic pressure and brute force.\\nSuch illegal actions  devalue the  international law that underpins the post-war world order. We hear statements trumpeted that not only call into question the legal validity of international treaties, but also prioritize self-serving unilateral approaches over decisions made within the United Nations. We are seeing an assault  by belligerent revisionism on the modern system of international law. There have been attacks on the basic principles of the Middle East peace process, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on the Iranian nuclear programme, commitments under the framework of  the World Trade Organization, the multilateral Paris Agreement on Climate Change and many more.\\nAt the same time, our Western colleagues continue to seek to replace the supremacy of law in world affairs with some kind of so-called rules-based order. Those\\n \\nrules themselves are invented depending on whatever is politically expedient and are a reflection of double standards. Baseless accusations of interference in the internal affairs of various countries are being made alongside overt attempts to undermine and topple democratically elected Governments. Efforts are being made to draw some countries into military alliances that are designed to further specific agendas against the will of the peoples of those countries, while other States are threatened with punishment for their free choice of partners and allies. It is telling that aggressive attacks on international institutions are being accompanied by attempts to privatize their secretariat structures and grant them the rights of intergovernmental bodies in the hope of manipulating them later.\\nThe shrinking space for constructive international cooperation, escalating confrontations, a growing overall lack of predictability, and a substantially higher risk of spontaneous conflicts all affect the work of this global Organization. The international  community has to pay a high price for the parochial, self-serving ambitions of a small group of countries. The collective mechanisms for responding to common security challenges have stalled. Diplomacy and a culture of negotiation and compromise are increasingly replaced by dictates and unilateral extraterritorial restrictions effected without the consent of the Security Council. Such measures, which have already been applied to dozens of countries, are ineffective as well as illegal, as demonstrated by the more  than  half-century  of the United States blockade of Cuba, which has been condemned by the entire international community.\\nOnce again, however, the lessons are not being drawn from history. The number of those who  want  to hand down verdicts without bothering with charges or trials is not getting any smaller. Today assumptions in the spirit of the notorious “highly likely” approach seem to provide sufficient grounds for some of our Western colleagues to make accusations against anyone they want to. We have already been through that, and we well remember how often spurious pretexts have been used to justify interventions and unleash wars, as was the case in Yugoslavia in 1999, Iraq in 2003 and Libya in 2011. The same methods are being used in Syria today. On 14 April, missile strikes were launched against Syria on a completely invented pretext, just hours before international inspectors were expected to arrive at the site of an incident that had been staged. This is a warning against any further provocations\\nby terrorists and their patrons involving the use of chemical weapons, which would be unacceptable.\\nThe conflict in Syria has already lasted seven years. The failed attempt to effect regime change, which was orchestrated from outside and relied on extremists, nearly resulted in the country’s disintegration and the emergence of a terrorist caliphate in its place. Russia’s energetic action, in response to the request of the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic and supported by diplomatic efforts in the context of the Astana process, helped prevent that devastating  scenario. The Syrian National Dialogue Congress, initiated by Russia, Iran and Turkey in Sochi in January, established the conditions for a political settlement in line with Security Council resolution 2254 (2015), and the basis for the intra-Syrian constitutional committee now being established in Geneva. Its agenda includes the restoration of ruined infrastructure in order to facilitate the return of millions of refugees to their homes. Assistance in addressing those issues in the interest of all Syrians, without double standards, must become a priority for international efforts and the activities of United Nations agencies.\\nDespite the complexity of the situation in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Libya, we  must  not  lose  sight  of the long-standing Palestinian question. A just and equitable solution to that issue is crucial to improving the situation throughout the Middle East. I want to warn against any unilateral  approaches  in  this area or attempts to monopolize this peace process. Today, as never before, the international community should consolidate its efforts with the aim of restarting talks on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative. Russia will continue to do its utmost to facilitate the process, including within the Middle East Quartet and in cooperation with the League of Arab States and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. Mutually acceptable agreements must ensure the peaceful and safe coexistence of the two States of Israel and Palestine.\\nHere at the United Nations, which was created on the basis of lessons learned from the Second World War, we must all think about a future in which the repetition of past mistakes should have no place. This year marks the eightieth anniversary of the notorious Munich agreement crowning the criminal policy of appeasement of the Third Reich, a sad example of the catastrophic consequences that can result from national\\n \\negotism, disregard for international law and attempts to solve problems at others’ expense.\\nRegrettably, in a number of countries today not only has the vaccine against the Nazi plague been weakened, but a rising campaign to rewrite history and whitewash war criminals and their associates is  emerging.  In our view, the campaigns being waged in a number of countries to demolish monuments to the liberators of Europe are an outrage. We call on the Assembly to support the draft of this year’s versin of the annual resolution on the inadmissibility of glorification of the Nazis.\\nThe growth of radical nationalism and neo-fascism in Ukraine, where criminals who fought under Waffen- SS banners have been declared heroes, is one of the main factors in the protracted intra-Ukrainian conflict. The only way to settle that conflict is to ensure the comprehensive and consistent implementation in good faith of the Minsk package of measures, approved unanimously by the Security Council in its resolution 2202 (2015). We support the activities of the Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and are ready to provide its monitors with United Nations protection.\\nHowever, instead of implementing the Minsk agreements and engaging in dialogue with Donetsk and Luhansk, Kyiv continues to harbour the illusion that it may be able to put occupying forces in Donbas with the support of the West and is increasingly threatening to resort to military options. The sponsors of the current Kyiv authorities must bring their clients to their senses, make them lift the blockade of Donbas and end discrimination against ethnic minorities throughout Ukraine.\\nIn Kosovo, the international military presence authorized by the Security Council is being transformed into a United States military base, and Kosovo armed forces are being created. The agreements between Belgrade and Pristina brokered by the European Union are not being implemented. Russia calls on the parties to engage in dialogue in accordance with the principles of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) and will support a decision that would be acceptable for Serbia. In general, we urge that the Balkans not be once again transformed into an arena for confrontation or declared to be someone’s particular patrimony. The peoples of the Balkans must not be forced to face a false choice,\\nand we must prevent new dividing lines from emerging in the region.\\nWe need to shape an architecture of equal and indivisible security elsewhere in the world, including the Asia-Pacific region. We welcome the positive developments on the Korean peninsula following the logic of the Russian-Chinese road map. It is important to encourage that process, which should be based on continuing the rapprochement between the  parties and on promoting the practical implementation of the important arrangements arrived at by Pyongyang and Seoul through the Security Council. We will continue to work to launch a multilateral process aimed at establishing a robust mechanism for peace and security in North-East Asia as soon as possible.\\nThe denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is among the tasks before the international community in the key security area of the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Regrettably, serious obstacles to that track continue to pile up. The unilateral withdrawal by the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, in violation of Security Council resolution 2231 (2015), and despite Iran’s full compliance with its obligations, came on top of the lack of progress in the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. We will do everything possible to preserve the deal approved by the Security Council.\\nWe are seeing increasingly negative  trends  in  the activities of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) whereby the West is attempting to transform the Technical Secretariat into an instrument for punishing undesirable Governments, which risks compromising the OPCW’s independent professional status, the universality of the Chemical Weapons Convention and the  exclusive  prerogatives of the Security Council. Those and other problems in the area of non-proliferation were discussed in detail in the Security Council on 26 September (see S/PV.8362), convened at a very timely moment by the United States presidency.\\nWe firmly believe that any problems or concerns that arise in international relations should be addressed through a substantive dialogue. If there are any bones of contention, we should come together around the negotiating table, engage in talks, present facts, heed\\n \\nthe our partners’ counterarguments and seek a balance of interests.\\nIn the past couple of years, the debate on abuses in cyberspace has become more intense. I would like to draw attention to the fact that it was Russia that initiated discussion of international information-security issues at the United Nations 20 years ago. Against the backdrop of recent developments, it is becoming ever more urgent that under the auspices of the United Nations we should develop global rules for the responsible behaviour of States in cyberspace, including the principles of the non-use of force, non-interference in internal affairs and respect for State sovereignty. We intend to introduce a draft resolution to that effect in the First Committee. We also believe that it is important to start work on a convention on cybercrime, and we envisage holding the relevant discussions in the Third Committee.\\nIt is more essential than ever to seek mutually acceptable agreements and the mutual consideration of interests in the areas of global trade and economic relations, which today are being subjected to an unprecedented degree of politicization. The values of free trade are being held hostage to trade wars and other forms of unfair competition.\\nRussia has consistently  promoted  a  philosophy of shared economic development,  as  enshrined  in  the Greater Eurasian Partnership initiative launched by President Vladimir Putin, a large-scale project open to all Asian and European States regardless of their membership in other integration associations. If consistently implemented, it could help to develop a the space for extensive economic cooperation in Eurasia. In the long term, it could lay the foundations for a renewed continental security architecture fit for the realities of the twenty-first century.\\nRussia will continue to do its utmost to build a world based on law, truth and justice, and we are not alone in that aspiration. Together with us, our allies and partners in the Collective Security Treaty Organization, the Eurasian Economic Community, the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) group and an overwhelming majority of other countries are advocating for the democratization of all aspects of international affairs and in the interests of all States, without exception. The West should also heed that voice, which is becoming\\nmore and more evident in the activities of the Group  of 20.\\nIn today’s turbulent circumstances, the growing relevance of the United Nations — the only existing forum for overcoming differences and coordinating the activities of the international community — is an objective reality. Cooperation, with a view to arriving at broadly acceptable solutions, was a priority built into the foundations of the United Nations from the very start. Today we must not fail to live up to the high goals and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and its dedication by the drafters to future generations.\\nWe should recall the art of negotiation in order to be worthy of their legacy. Many of today’s problems can be solved only on a basis of equality and mutual respect. Dictates and coercion, hallmarks of the era of colonialism, should once and for all be filed away in the archives or, better yet, consigned to the dustbin of history.\\nSome great statesmen of the past have bequeathed to us many words of wisdom that have come to be aphorisms. Let me quote just one, from President Harry Truman: “The responsibility of the great States is to serve and not to dominate the world”.\\nI hope that a culture of mutually respectful dialogue will finally prevail. Russia will do everything it can to achieve that.\\n']"

       "['I congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session, and I hope that the decisions and initiatives taken by the Assembly will play an effective role in resolving the problems that our world is currently facing.\\nFifteen years have passed since the painful terrorist attack in this city, a disaster whose human dimensions moved the entire world. On that day, no one imagined that this occurrence would lead to larger disasters or result in a devastating war in the Middle East and the spread of insecurity across the globe. This war has sown the seeds of borderless terrorism everywhere on Earth. Today, the most pressing question as to why we are facing such a situation should be on the agenda of every international forum. We need to find out which approaches, policies and erroneous actions have paved the way for the spread of insecurity throughout the world and what the world will look like 15 years from now.\\nSecurity has become a global problem at a time when major Powers are mainly focusing on advancing different methods of repression and military intervention under the pretext of creating a secure environment for their citizens. The genesis of borderless violent extremism and terrorism could be attributed to the security strategies developed by major Powers in the past 15 years. The main lesson to be learned from the analysis of this trend is that security in one region at the cost of insecurity in others is not only impossible, but it also leads to greater insecurity everywhere. Terrorists have even gone as far as claiming to have established States in the Levant, Iraq and Libya. More unfortunately, they hide their nefarious intents behind religious literature, thereby turning a compassionate religion into an instrument of violence and terror by spreading extremist and takfiri propaganda, which is all too regrettable.\\nThe century that began with terror and violence in New York should not continue with hostile competition and expanding conflicts in the Middle East. Today the discourse of hatred and violence in the Middle East and North Africa is spreading with astonishing speed. The region is caught in a web of the most savage and destructive of policies. Millions of Syrians are stranded in deserts or on high seas, and hundreds of thousands of them die a violent death. Iraqis of every ethnic group are concerned about their territorial integrity and the future of their homeland. The defenceless people of Yemen are subjected to daily aerial bombardments. Following decades of occupation and atrocities, Afghanistan has yet to be released from the grip of suffering, violence and terror. The oppressed Palestinians continue to be afflicted by the apartheid policies and atrocities set by the usurping Zionist regime.\\nUndoubtedly, if the region is to reverse the current dangerous trends and move towards development and stability, certain countries must stop bombing their neighbours and abandon their support for takfiri terrorist groups, while accepting responsibility and trying to compensate for past mistakes. If the Saudi Government is serious about its vision for development and regional security, it must cease and desist from the use of divisive policies, stop spreading hate ideology and refrain from trampling upon the rights of neighbours. It must accept its responsibility for the protection of the lives and dignity of pilgrims and construct relations with the nations in the region on the basis of mutual respect and accountability.\\nThe future of our region rests on dealing with fundamental challenges, including security crises. Due to inefficiency and lack of Government legitimacy, we will not be able to combat criminal and terrorist networks without genuine democracy or a participatory approach at national and transnational levels. We believe that countries in our region can create a shared future on the basis of their common history and culture and by isolating terrorist groups. We should never again allow our region to run the risk of dismemberment, given the impact of what took place close to a century ago.\\nIran’s principled approach calls for constructive partnership with our neighbours, with a view to establishing an enduring order based on shared security and efforts aimed at enhancing the developments of countries in the region and mutually beneficial economic cooperation. In order to uproot violence in the region there is no choice but to focus on promoting democracy, citizenship rights and economic development.\\nIran opposes any kind of sectarianism and any attempt to promote religious divisions. For centuries, the Muslim people, be they Shiites or Sunnis, have lived and continue to live together in harmony and mutual respect. Attempts to turn religious dissimilarities into tense confrontations are rooted in the vested interests of certain countries, which are trying to hide their quests for power behind religious slogans. Iran considers it imperative to preserve the territorial integrity of States, keep national borders intact, enhance people’s right to self-determination and uphold the principle of refraining from the threat or use of force. We also reiterate the need to use diplomacy in conflict resolution.\\nDespite today’s difficulties, I have hope in tomorrow. I have no doubt that we can prevail through prudence and wisdom. The experience acquired through dialogue between Iran and the P5+1 and the fruition of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) are indicative of the success that we could achieve through moderation, constructive interaction and the promotion of dialogue. A long, complicated and unnecessary crisis was brought to an end by the adoption of a win-win approach. The deal confirmed the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme through the use of confidence-building mechanisms and entails the closure of the so-called possible military dimensions file and the reinstatement of Iran’s right to develop a peaceful nuclear programme.\\nThe deal also has put an end to unfounded concerns, leading to the removal of the brutal sanctions imposed against Iran. Beyond the nuclear file, however, the JCPOA holds important lessons the resolving complicated international problems. The deal is not only a political agreement; it also represents a creative approach and method for engaging in constructive interaction with a view to peacefully resolving crises and challenges. The lessons learned from the JCPOA will serve to improve international relations. We should never forget that these pressures, sanctions and illegal threats against the Iranian people, designed to fully dismantle Iran’s enrichment programme, were all defeated. Today, the Security Council and the International Atomic Energy Agency have formally accepted Iran’s peaceful nuclear programme.\\nThe United States is fully aware that the JCPOA constitutes a recognized multilateral agreement and that any failure on the part of the United States in implementing it would constitute an wrongful act under international law, to which the international community would object. Any failure in the implementation of the JCPOA will further erode the credibility of the United States around the world.\\nBreaches in compliance with the JCPOA by the United States in the past several months represents an error that should be rectified forthwith. Unfortunately, such illegal actions are not unprecedented. The latest example of this is the recent United States Supreme Court ruling which affirmed the legality of the seizure of billions of dollars in assets belonging to the Iranian people. This experience demonstrates that Zionist pressure groups could go so far as to persuade the United States Congress to pass indefensible legislation that forces the highest American judicial institution to violate peremptory norms of international law.\\nWith God’s help, the Iranian people’s fortitude and the increased participation of Iran’s partners from various regions around the world, and only eight months after the lifting of the cruel nuclear-related sanctions against my country, the economy of Iran, as the safest and most profitable destination for investment in our region, is showing clear improvement. Iran’s economic growth rate surpassed 4 per cent in the spring of 2016, the inflation rate dropped to single digits, and Iran has come close to pre-sanction levels of oil production and exports. All in all, we are seeing greater development in the economic, scientific and technological sectors of the country.\\nIran is one of the rare oil-producing countries that may be able to offset the shocking impact of the sharp slide in oil price in 2014. In order to attract investment, we are intent on strengthening economic stability and consistency through economic reforms and fiscal and financial discipline while preserving low rates of inflation. Economic growth is set to increase to around 5 per cent by the end of 2016. Based on all domestic and international predictions, Iran is currently enjoying one the highest growth rates among oil-producing countries.\\nIn conclusion, I would like to clearly state that it is my deep belief that, despite setbacks, moderation will prevail over extremism, peace will triumph over violence, enlightenment will overcome ignorance and, finally, justice will conquer injustice. What is important is that we channel our beliefs, hopes and efforts towards realizing peace and justice. If we do so, there is no doubt that the Almighty will assist all those who endeavour for peace, justice and moderation, and that God will help those who assist Him by defending his path, for the Lord is strong and mighty.\\n',\n",
       " 'I wish to congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson on his election as the President of the General Assembly at its seventy- first session. I believe that under his presidency, this session will make good progress on its agenda. I also wish to express appreciation for the effective work of Mr. Lykketoft, President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. I also would like to pay tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who has with modesty and a drive for harmony and inclusiveness worked diligently and in a down-to-earth manner over the past decade and whose work has contributed significantly to world peace, sustainable development and the advancement and protection of human rights around the world.\\nIn 2015, the United Nations held a summit to consider the post-2015 development agenda and adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which has offered a new vision for global development. At the summit, China’s President Xi Jinping delivered a speech (see A/70/PV.7) entitled, “Towards win-win partnerships for sustainable development”, in which he expounded on China’s principles and positions. The year 2016 is the first year for the implementation of that Agenda.\\nThe general debate at the seventy-first session focuses on “The Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world”, a theme that could not be more relevant. On behalf of the Chinese Government, I would like to state today that China has taken action to advance the Agenda for Sustainable Development, and it has been one of the first States to submit its national plan on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda to the United Nations.\\nSustainable development concerns development first and foremost, and development underpins every human achievement. Without development, nothing is sustainable. The lack of development is often at the root of many of the world’s problems — poverty, the refugee crisis, war, conflicts or terrorism. All of these could be attributed to insufficient development, and none of them can be satisfactorily resolved without development. Only development can guarantee people’s fundamental rights and interests. Only development can root out the causes for global challenges. Only development can promote human civilization and progress.\\nOf course, development must be sustainable in all its dimensions. Otherwise, development, and especially growth, will stall. Growth will stall and be held back. Development cannot be sustainable if it is unbalanced and unequal and widens the gap between the North and the South, and between the rich and the poor. Development cannot be sustainable if it is expensive, if it is driven by high consumption with high pollution and high carbon emissions, or if it depletes resources and strains the environment. Development cannot be sustainable if economic growth and social progress are not well coordinated. Only when we have a profound understanding of the implications of sustainability, make progress in poverty reduction at all levels, engage in North-South and South-South cooperation, adapt to climate change, and promote equal sharing and green development can we ensure that development will hold its ground and be sustainable.\\nSustainable development must be inclusive and interconnected. Currently, the sustainable development endeavour is faced with great challenges. Regional conflicts and hotspots are without end. Traditional and non-traditional security threats intertwine, and the environment for sustainable development gives no reason for optimism. World economic recovery remains lukewarm, and globalization faces strong headwinds. The momentum for sustainable development is weak. There are frequent outbreaks of major infectious diseases and the eruption of natural disasters. Other issues to be faced are energy and resource security, food security and financial security. As those elements become intertwined, sustainable development necessarily faces an uphill battle. Such difficult moments call for greater confidence.\\nHumankind has the wisdom and the ability to find a way out. For that to happen, there must be cooperation and a spirit of working together to overcome difficulties. It is time that the international community assumes a new perspective, sees itself as a community with a shared future and interconnected interests and makes concerted efforts to tackle global challenges.\\nFor sustainable development to evolve, we must keep both short-term and long-term interests in mind while making concrete efforts to tackle challenges, actively transform and change our world, and achieve our new vision. We are ready to and must uphold the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Without peace and stability, there will be no sustainable development; even the development gains already attained risk being lost.\\nThe hard-won peace that has prevailed over the past 70 or more years testifies to the effectiveness of the international order and the norms of international relations based on the United Nations Charter. These norms and this order must be resolutely upheld since they not only serve the common interests of the people of all countries but also provide the most essential guarantee for achieving sustainable development.\\nAll countries need to observe and effectively implement the purposes and principles of the Charter, support the leading role of the United Nations and the Security Council in global affairs, and support the reform and improvement of global governance mechanisms to reflect the changes in the international, political and economic landscape. A new concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security should be nurtured. A global partnership that features dialogue instead of confrontation, and mutual, win-win benefits should be established.\\nWe must pursue political solutions to hotspot issues. Political solutions are the fundamental way out. History has repeatedly shown that to repress violence with force can only lead to more hatred and warfare from which no winner will emerge. Parties involved in conflicts must renounce a zero-sum mentality, settle disputes through dialogue, address differences through consultation and seek reconciliation with tolerance. The mediation efforts of the international community must be fair and impartial; they should facilitate the settlement of issues, not invite new problems.\\nOn Syria, we must remain committed to a political solution. The international community should encourage all relevant parties in Syria to end the fighting at an early date and reach a comprehensive political solution.\\nOn the Korean nuclear issue, we should remain committed to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, uphold peace and stability on the peninsula and seek consultation and dialogue so as to effectively maintain the international nuclear-non-proliferation regime.\\nTerrorism is the common enemy of humankind and must be combatted resolutely. At the same time, double standards should not be applied, nor should terrorism be linked with particular countries, races or religions.\\nWe must work together for the safe, steady recovery of the world economy, which cannot afford to maintain the long-term sluggishness we see now. Otherwise, sustainable development will be a fountain without a source. The current world economy is faced with both insufficient aggregate demand and prominent structural contradictions. We need to employ various kinds of effective policy instruments in a holistic manner, combine demand management with supply-side reform, and balance short-term policies with long-term ones.\\nWe call on all countries to make concerted efforts to drive the global economy along a road of strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth. Given their significant influence, major economies need to act responsibly in policymaking, particularly when coordinating macroeconomic policies. While focusing on their own growth, they also need to strive to reduce negative spillover and refrain from adding to the weakness of the global economic recovery.\\nEconomic globalization, represented by liberalization in and facilitation of trade and investment, has been a significant driving force behind rapid global growth in past decades, but it is no panacea to the ills of the world. Frankly, globalization has to some degree taken its toll on industries and communities in certain countries. Active measures need to be taken to address the problem, but it is always important to keep in mind the bigger picture, instead of focusing only on narrower interests.\\nGlobalization is consistent with the long-term and fundamental interests of all countries. It is the trend of the times. Countries need to firmly oppose protectionism in all its forms, resolutely uphold the free-trade regime represented by the World Trade Organization and promote sustained and sound economic growth for all countries through win-win and all-win cooperation. We must exert ourselves to address global challenges facing humankind. Greater attention and more support need to be given to Africa and the least developed countries to help them speed up industrialization, ensure food security and eliminate poverty and hunger so that more people can lead a life of decency and dignity.\\nMore needs to be done to create an international environment that helps reduce inequality and imbalance in global development. International institutions should spend their new resources on helping developing countries on a priority basis. Developed countries should make good on their official development assistance commitments, while developing countries need to pursue self-development and find paths suited to their national conditions.\\nAs we speak, the world is facing the largest refugee crisis since the Second World War. It is imperative to ensure refugee access to basic living conditions in order to stave off humanitarian crises. It is of fundamental importance to root out the causes of war and renew development so that countries of origin of refugees can embark on a path of enduring peace, development and prosperity.\\nCountries need to stay committed to the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities, equity and respective capabilities. They also need to jointly tackle climate change and work for the Paris Agreement to be universally accepted and take effect at an early date. Developed countries need to play a leading role, deliver on their emissions-reduction pledges and help developing countries improve their capacity to mitigate and adapt to climate change.\\nSince China adopted its reform and opening-up policy, the Chinese economy has maintained rapid growth, becoming the world’s second-largest economy in 2010. In 2014, China’s gross domestic product reached $10 trillion. In recent years, despite a greater basis of measurement for development, overall global complexity and long-accumulated underlying domestic issues, China has relied on reform and innovation to maintain a medium-high growth rate and promoted economic transformation and upgrading.\\nIn the first half of this year, our growth rate was 6.7 per cent, which was among the fastest in the major economies. Over 13 million new urban jobs are added annually. In other words, in the first eight months of this year, 9.5 million new urban jobs were created. Every percentage point of growth now equals several percentage points of growth in previous years, and the yearly economic increment is tantamount to the economic aggregate of a middle-income country. China’s effective management of its own affairs has been its greatest contribution to the world. Its contribution to global economic growth has been around 30 per cent.\\nHowever, we remain sober about our achievements and believe that China remains a developing country; there is still a long way to go before China achieves modernization. We will continue to give priority to development and pursue comprehensive social and economic growth, maintain a medium-high speed of economic growth and move to a medium-high level of development. China will continue to promote development through deepening reform.\\nReform has held the key to our previous achievements in development, and the same will hold true for the future. We will promote development through expanding our opening-up policy. China’s experience in past decades proves that a closed-door policy only leads to stagnation and backwardness, and it is opening up that brings development and prosperity. With a firm commitment to the win-win strategy of opening up, China will open its door even wider to the outside world.\\nChina will promote development by upholding peace. The prolonged sufferings of war have made the Chinese people cherish peace more than ever. As a dedicated follower of the path of peaceful development, China will pursue friendship and cooperation with all countries on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence. We uphold a mutual respect among all countries, regardless of their size.\\nChina also believes in working through dialogue, negotiation and friendly consultation to address various differences and issues, including disputes over territory and maritime rights and interests. We need to expand common ground, shelve differences and make continuous efforts for regional peace and stability.\\nChina has always worked for the peaceful settlement of hotspot issues. On the occasion of this year’s session of the General Assembly, China has clearly indicated that it will provide $300 million worth of humanitarian assistance to relevant countries and international organizations. Additionally, China will provide assistance on all fronts to the underdeveloped and least developed countries.\\nChina is a developing country with a population of 1.3 billion. We need to run our own affairs effectively while working to fulfil our due international responsibilities. By the end of 2015, China had contributed a total of over ¥400 billion to 166 countries and international and regional organizations and provided training in various sectors to over 12 million professionals from other developing countries. Going forward, China will strengthen cooperation with other developing countries and do whatever it can to help African countries and the least developing countries.\\nChina will only increase, not reduce, its support and assistance to other countries only as our economy grows. We stand ready to work with all countries to achieve common development and prosperity and to support sustainable development and international cooperation in relevant fields. By 2020, China will increase its total annual contributions to United Nations development agencies by $100 million over its 2015 contribution level. China is a country that backs its words with action. We will translate our commitments into real actions.\\nAchieving the goals for sustainable development is our shared task. Transforming our world and making it a better place is the common aspiration of all of us. China stands ready to work with other members of the international community, and make appropriate contributions to building a world free from want where development and dignity are ensured for all.\\n',\n",
       " 'Last year, from this same rostrum, at the seventieth anniversary session of the General Assembly, much was said concerning the critical turning point in world development. The keynote was the recognition that humankind is moving from a bipolar and monopolar world order towards multipolar and democratic systems of international relations with regard to dealing with common challenges and threats, which we can overcome only through joint efforts. It was rightly stressed that there is a need to change the very philosophy of inter-State communication by avoiding attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of States or to impose development models on countries and peoples.\\nUnfortunately, despite having acknowledged that fact, many Western countries continue to favour their entrenched ideas of mentoring, dominance, exclusiveness and the realization of self-interests by any means, rather than promote just and equitable cooperation. We see, in the bloodshed in the Middle East and North Africa, the consequences of such arrogance and their sense of infallibility in their pushing forward unilateral and reckless solutions to complex conflicts. As a result, the foundations of world stability are being destroyed. It is high time to draw the necessary lessons and avoid sinking into catastrophe in Syria.\\nLargely thanks to Russia’s military response and assistance at the request of the legitimate Government of Syria, it has been possible to prevent the collapse of that country’s statehood and the disintegration of the country under the onslaught of terrorists. Our involvement provided the impetus for the establishment of the International Syria Support Group, which seeks to start a meaningful political process so that the Syrians themselves can determine the future of their country through an inclusive dialogue among all ethnic and religious groups. That is uncontestable. It has been acknowledged in the relevant Security Council resolutions and is enshrined in the recent agreements between Russia and the United States as Co-Chairs of the International Syria Support Group. We thank everyone who has supported us in those efforts.\\nIt is now essential to prevent the collapse of those agreements and to carry out an unbiased and impartial investigation into the incidents in Deir ez-Zor and Aleppo, which undermine the agreements, especially given that there are quite a few people wishing to sabotage both the agreements and a settlement of the conflict in Syria. It is crucial to comply with the demand of the Security Council to separate what is known as the moderate opposition from the terrorists. And, in that regard, a particular responsibility lies with the United States and the members of the United States- led coalition.\\nIf we truly wish to resolve the Syrian crisis and the appalling humanitarian situation there, the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham, Jabhat al-Nusrah and associated extremist groups must be suppressed. That is key to reaching a cessation of hostilities and national reconciliation. Today, it is unpardonable to put off intra-Syrian negotiations, as well as to impose preconditions to them. Everything must be done in line with Security Council resolution 2254 (2015).\\nSabotaging the process — in particular through the use of external forces, including their advisers and supporters — has a negative impact on the reputation of the United Nations and leads us to believe that the reason for it lies in an attempt to change the regime. We have seen that sort of zero-sum game in Ukraine, which is very close to us, in the unconstitutional attempts to overthrow the Government and now in Ukraine’s refusal to fulfil the Minsk Agreement of 12 February 2015. By and large, the attempt to use those conflicts to achieve self-serving geopolitical goals has been obvious to everyone.\\nThe latest meeting of the International Syria Contact Group gives us reason to remain very cautiously optimistic. More broadly, it is only through the genuine implementation of all agreements that we will be able to have, in the Euro-Atlantic area, equal and indivisible security for mutually beneficial cooperation, as was stated at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe nearly 20 years ago.\\nNeither NATO nor the European Union will be able to replace a truly collective unification of efforts in the interest of all without losers and winners. And it is also utterly unacceptable to hold athletic competitions — which have always brought peoples together, strengthening friendship and mutual trust — hostage for reasons of political ambition. Attempts to manipulate the outcome of competitions does not honour those who flaunt their allegiance to fair competition but actually violate the General Assembly principles supporting the independence and autonomy of sports.\\nIn today’s world, we cannot be guided by the philosophy of the anti-heroes of George Orwell’s dystopic novel Animal Farm, where all animals are equal but some are more equal than others. In the enlightened twenty-first century, it is simply indecent to adopt the role of mentor to everyone else, reserving for oneself the right to use doping in sports, launch unilateral adventures bypassing the United Nations, conduct geopolitical experiments that cost millions of human lives, engage in the extraterritorial blackmail of everyone, including one’s closest allies, while what is really intended is to advance one’s own financial profit, or even to set the criteria for the greatness of a particular country. All of that is unworthy of the principles of freedom and equality, on the basis of which great nations have grown and which are now being used by their elites to threaten the entire world.\\nThis year, we mark the seventieth anniversary of the Nuremberg Tribunal decisions. The anniversary cautions us against forgetting the lessons of the Second World War and reminds us of the catastrophic consequences of attempting to determine the fate of the world by suppressing the legitimate interests of other States and peoples. The freedoms of expression and peaceful assembly should not be used as a cover for condoning radical movements that profess a Nazi ideology and support the glorification of the Nazis and their accomplices. The persistence of such vicious instincts dictates the need for consistent efforts to place a solid barrier in the way of neo-Nazism and revanchism, strengthen inter-ethnic and intercultural accord and rally the young generation around the ideas of justice and equality. We invite everyone to take part in the nineteenth World Festival of Youth and Students in Sochi in October 2017.\\nHegemony has no place in the future, if we want it to be a just future that gives people the opportunity to choose their own ways of development. That entails the need to learn to respect one’s partners and respect the cultural and civilizational diversity of the modern world. We must therefore return to our origins — the norms and principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter and other instruments of the world Organization. Our commitment to that approach was reaffirmed in the Declaration of the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China on the Promotion of International Law, signed on 25 June. The observance of the principles of the sovereign equality of States and non-interference in their internal affairs should become a measure of the decency and legitimacy of any member of the world community.\\nWe cannot address the global issues of countering international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and other transboundary threats without abandoning the philosophy of exclusiveness and permissiveness. There should be no place for double standards in fighting terrorism. Truly universal joint efforts are required to create a broad counter- terrorist front, as President Putin proposed from this rostrum last year (see A/70/PV.13). The tragedies in Iraq, Libya, Yemen and Syria have proved the need to stop opportunistic attempts to use extremists as a way to advance geopolitical intentions. Before it is too late, it is necessary to think about the task of preventing the proliferation of terrorist and extremist ideology, which literally holds youth hostage in various regions of the world. We are drafting a Security Council resolution aimed at mobilizing efforts to eliminate such evils. We are looking forward to support for our initiative.\\nThe elimination of the breeding grounds for radicalism would be facilitated significantly by resolving the conflict between Israel and Palestine. It is important to overcome the deep deadlock, which is stipulated in the 1 July 2016 report of the Quartet of Middle East facilitators. We call for the implementation of its recommendations.\\nWe are also seriously concerned about non-proliferation and arms control. There have been attempts to replace the key objectives of maintaining strategic stability in all its components with populist slogans of “nuclear zero”. We see a number of countries possessing nuclear arsenals not participating in the existing treaties. The fundamental Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is being put to a serious test. Its parties find it more difficult to speak a common language, especially in a situation when certain nuclear Powers torpedo any compromises regarding the start of the negotiations on the establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery in the Middle East.\\nRussia has consistently supported the liberation of humankind from the threat of nuclear weapons and other types of weapons of mass destruction. However, progress towards nuclear disarmament must be made in the context of the full consideration of a whole set of factors that affect strategic stability, including the impact of unilateral global missile defence systems, the development of strategic non-nuclear strike weapons, the threat of the placement of weapons in outer space, the inability to ensure the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, and the growing imbalance in conventional arms in Europe.\\nWe note the growing support for our initiative to draft an international convention for the suppression of acts of chemical and biological terrorism. The start of serious negotiations on that issue and on the Russia-China draft treaty on the prevention of the placement of weapons in outer space would help break the impasse in the key body of the United Nations multilateral disarmament architecture: the Conference on Disarmament. We call for substantial examination of our proposals to improve the Convention on Biological and Toxin Weapons.\\nNATO member countries brought conventional arms control in Europe to a deep deadlock. Our attempts to save it have faced a tough ideology-driven counteraction. All ideas to return to that issue would be meaningful only if NATO countries recognized the absolute futility of ultimatums aimed at achieving unilateral advantages. We continue to be open to an equitable and mutually respectful dialogue with NATO, including through the Collective Security Treaty Organization.\\nIt is necessary to work towards strengthening stability and equal and indivisible security in other parts of the world, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. The recent actions of North Korea, which violate Security Council resolutions, must be stopped. We call on Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear-missile programmes and return to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons regime. However, it is inadmissible to use that situation as a pretext for a massive militarization of North-East Asia and a deployment of another set of United States global missile-defence systems. All sides must refrain from the further escalation of tension and embark on the way toward a political and diplomatic settlement of the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula through the resumption of the talks.\\nWe will continue the dialogue within the framework of the East Asia Summits on the establishment of regional security and cooperation architecture in the Asia-Pacific region based on non-bloc foundations. A number of participating countries, including Russia, India, China and Indonesia, have submitted their views on that topic.\\nWe invite the countries of the region to agree on the ways to implement the initiative presented by President Putin to establish an extended Eurasia Partnership with the participation of the Eurasian Economic Union countries and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, as well as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and other interested States. I would like to underline that the aforementioned initiative is open and fully in line with the earlier plans to create a trade bloc between Russia and the European Union and is founded on the basis of World Trade Organization norms and principles, unlike other projects involving close trade blocs that undermine the unity of global trade systems.\\nWe will continue to promote the unification agenda in various international forums — the United Nations, the forum of the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa group, the SCO, and the Group of 20 (G-20). The recent summit in Hangzhou reaffirmed the status of the G-20 as a leading global economic and financial forum. We thank the Chinese chairmanship for its efforts to use that representative platform effectively for the exchange of views on the key issues of the global economy and on policies for the subsequent promotion of such agreements in the universal format of the United Nations.\\nThe signing of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change has become an important event among United Nations activities. The communication of nationally determined contributions on a voluntary basis moves us toward achieving the objectives of the Agreement, namely, to hold the increase in the average global temperature to below 2°C. Clear rules and procedures to implement the provisions of the Paris Agreement, bearing in mind the interests of all countries participating in the process, should be developed in order to achieve success.\\nIn that context, the launch of market and non-market mechanisms to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, as stipulated in article VI of the Agreement, is a priority matter. In the final analysis, that would be of crucial importance in preventing violations of the competitive environment and the transfer of polluting industries and dirty production from one country to another, which hampers the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\\nThe United Nations was established to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and develop equitable international cooperation. Today, that covers all areas of international life, including communication, political and military aspects of security, climate protection, conflict settlement, peacekeeping, ensuring human rights and freedoms, sustainable development, regulating information technology, and efforts to combat terrorism, drug- trafficking and corruption. Furthermore, it includes issues ranging from the eradication of infectious diseases to ensuring the social responsibility of businesses and fostering scientific and technological progress.\\nIn addition, of course, the United Nations must promote civil dialogue, thereby strengthening pluralism, cultures and traditions and serving as a catalyst for progress in science and the arts. In essence, we are talking about preserving humanity in all of its riches and diversity. That goal should constitute the basis for our collective efforts. It should become an imperative for global development and an incentive for improving global governance and the true democratization of international relations.\\nI would like to express our gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, who has made enormous efforts, in his position as Secretary-General, to renew the United Nations through timely actions. We believe that the new Secretary-General will also make a valuable contribution.\\n',\n",
       " 'I congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. I am confident that his wisdom, leadership and experience will guide our session to success. Allow me also to thank Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, President at the seventieth session, for his important contributions to the work of the Assembly. My special gratitude extends to Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon for his leadership, commitment, tireless efforts and tremendous contributions during his ten years at the helm of the Organization.\\nLast year, 2015, we established a common vision for the world we live in. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction not only seek to address short-term challenges, but also to present a vision for greater partnership for people, the planet, peace and prosperity. The theme chosen for this session, “The Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world”, is therefore very opportune as we embark upon realizing our vision and turning our commitments into concrete results for our people.\\nI believe that achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is within our grasp. Our people, our children and grandchildren, expect us to deliver on our commitments. The implementation of the Millennium Development Goals has laid a solid foundation. Opportunities are plenty. Reform, innovation, creativity and economic restructuring are setting countries on a path to prosperity. The internationalization of production is making possible global and regional cooperation and integration for sustainable development. New advances in science and technology are paving the way for the fourth Industrial Revolution, which promises to bring humanity to a new, higher level of development.\\nBut challenges are by no means few. Developing countries in particular continue to suffer from the weak global economic recovery, rising protectionism in major economies, climate change, natural disasters and epidemics. Food and water security, the depletion of natural resources, and the humanitarian and migration crises also have negative and far-reaching implications for many countries and regions. Development and income gaps are widening at the national, regional and global levels. The instability and tension, violence, conflicts, terrorism and violent extremism that are plaguing many regions are of particular concern. Power politics and the use, or threat of use, of force in international relations continue to be a threat to international peace and security.\\nThat is the reality of our world today, and it compels us to work together to promote multilateralism and adherence to international law for peace, cooperation and sustainable development. As has been demonstrated, multilateral cooperation has a growing role to play in international relations. We are seeing multilateral institutions expand, both in numbers and in strength. Multi-tiered cooperation and integration are taking shape. Multilateral solutions to common challenges prove to be the most effective and long-lasting, since no country, large or small, rich or poor, can afford to address those challenges alone. Multilateral institutions are also venues for countries to promote their interests, effectively manage disputes and differences and expand their development opportunities.\\nThat is why Viet Nam believes that multilateralism must be strengthened and the operation of multilateral institutions, particularly the United Nations, must be improved. The United Nations has an indispensable role to play by coordinating international responses to global challenges and facilitating development cooperation. No other organization is better at fostering partnerships and assisting countries to successfully implement the SDGs.\\nAccordingly, to ensure greater equality, democracy and transparency, the United Nations, including the Security Council, must undergo reform. The United Nations development system must have better resources and be more effective and efficient. We must ensure the broadest participation of all countries in discussions and formulations of resolutions and decisions, so that no country will be left behind.\\nInternational law remains the linchpin of a stable international security architecture and a strong multilateral system. Unfortunately, the role of the fundamental norms and principles of international law is underestimated. Unfair demands, unilateralism, power politics and the use of force to address international security and political issues have been creating tensions and confrontation, hindering efforts to peacefully settle disputes and conflicts.\\nThis is where the United Nations can and must play a stronger part. The Organization must take the lead in promoting adherence to international law and the Charter of the United Nations as the foundation for international peace and security. No country, big or small, can be exempt from the law. The United Nations should also work to strengthen preventive diplomacy and the peaceful settlement of disputes, utilizing all tools, as provided in Article 33 of the Charter.\\nAbove all, I believe that each country should align its national interests with those of humankind and immerse itself in the community of nations. A policy of humanity, peace and friendship will enable us to eliminate hatred, narrow gaps, manage differences and open up opportunities to find lasting solutions to all disputes and conflicts. Having suffered from decades of war, Viet Nam treasures peace and will spare no effort to maintain or achieve peace. We believe lasting peace can be secured only by long-term vision and a comprehensive and inclusive approach that harmonizes\\n16-29811 19/52 the interests of all stakeholders. We welcome recent positive developments in the relations between Cuba and the United States and support resolutions on ending the economic embargo against Cuba.\\nMultilateralism, international law, peace, cooperation and development are the key elements for building a peaceful, stable and prosperous Asia- Pacific region. Regional countries are working to promote initiatives for political, economic, social and cultural cooperation and integration, including new- generation free trade areas. However, the Asia-Pacific region contains risks of conflict, especially on the Korean peninsula and in the South China Sea — all and any of which can threaten regional and international peace, security and prosperity. With regard to certain recent complicated developments in the South China Sea, we call upon all parties concerned to exercise self-restraint and solve disputes by peaceful means in accordance with international law, including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, fully respect diplomatic and legal processes, implement the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and expedite the completion of the code of conduct for the South China Sea.\\nViet Nam is strongly committed to the SDGs and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. A plan of action for the implementation of the SDGs has been developed, and we are working with United Nations agencies to craft the strategic plan 2017-2021, as part of the Delivering as One initiative, to assist Viet Nam in the implementation of the SDGs. For us, implementing the SDGs is part of and also encompasses our efforts to restructure the economy and transform the growth model, develop sustainable infrastructure, ensure social justice, address inequalities and protect the environment. As one of the countries predicted to be hardest hit by climate change and sea-level rise, Viet Nam is expediting procedures for the early ratification of the Paris Agreement and is planning its implementation.\\nExperience has shown that success comes only when we take our development into our own hands. To transform the world, we must start with transforming ourselves and leave no one behind. Viet Nam believes it essential to bring its domestic resources into full play and mainstream sustainability into our development vision, strategies and policies, with the people at the centre. We also believe that we can succeed only with stronger global partnerships, in which the United Nations plays the convening and coordinating role. Viet Nam calls on developed countries to uphold their responsibility to take the lead in assisting developing countries, including Viet Nam, to realize the SDGs, especially in financing, capacity-building, technology transfer and trade facilitation.\\nAs a peace-loving and friendly nation, Viet Nam always pursues the foreign policy of independence, self-reliance, peace, cooperation and development. We strive to be a friend, a reliable partner and a responsible member of the international community. Our commitment to multilateralism and international law is unwavering, and we will spare no effort to contribute to peace, cooperation and development.\\nViet Nam has decided to present its candidacy for non-permanent membership of the Security Council for the term 2020-2021 and will continue to increase its participation in the United Nations peacekeeping operations. Viet Nam looks forward to stronger partnership and collaboration with the United Nations and Member States to realize the vision of transforming our world and ensuring a better future.\\n']"

       "'Allow me to start by extending my congratulations to Ms. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés and wishing much success to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy- third session. Let me also assure her that, by working with Member States and the United Nations family, we look forward to advancing the seven priorities set out in the agenda of the General Assembly at its seventy- third session.\\nFrom this rostrum, I would like to provide the General Assembly with the latest regarding the situation in Afghanistan and the gains, opportunities and challenges that my nation faces at this critical juncture, in addition to our views on other key global challenges.\\nThe record of accomplishments by this institution over the past 73  years  demonstrates  that,  wherever it might be and whoever it might impact, we cannot escape the ripple effect of, or de-link ourselves from, the global, national, communal and human connections that bind  us, whether  in relation  to  the environment,\\n \\nthe climate, international finance or even the cyber and technology arenas. It is therefore critically important to go beyond just words, the duplication of effort or ineffective models that intermingle and, at times, spur countervailing or lopsided interests.\\nAs Albert Einstein once said, “We cannot solve our problems with the same level of thinking that created them”. Whether we are addressing hunger, acute poverty, climate change, overpopulation, terrorism, conflict, displacement, inequality or organized crime, we all share and own bits and pieces of  the problem in the same way that we collectively benefit or learn from the solutions. As a result, we need to explore  new means and identify new tools for reaching a wider consensus through more thoughtful dialogue and results-oriented actions.\\nTo this day we do not have a globally and officially acceptable definition for terrorism, a nefarious phenomenon used by a rogue or politically connected criminal, State or non-State actor using religious, ideological, economic or psychological cover to disrupt the status quo, upend the global and nation State order and reach a particular set of radical goals through the sheer use of indiscriminate violence that no religion in its undistorted form condones.\\nWhile we are determined to fight with vigour against newer versions of terror presenting themselves as remnants of Da’esh in a few pockets inside Afghanistan, we are still struggling to fully comprehend the role that terror breeding grounds, sanctuaries and funding pools, in many cases tied to criminal and illicit drug networks, play in the use and spread of terrorism. We are still trying to figure out how to render terrorism impotent as a policy tool used by some to further specific agendas.\\nFor example, for almost a quarter of a century, Afghanistan experienced the loss of tens of thousands of innocent lives and major infrastructural damage. It is partly due to geography and partly due to shortsighted strategies and regional agendas that have generated an umbilical reliance on non-State actors, used to keep others unstable through violence and  the  promotion of extremism. It has resulted in complacency and impunity; therefore, we need to do more and go beyond ineffective norms to bring about change and accountability. We have asked our neighbouring States, especially Pakistan, to help targeted societies, including their own, to deal with this menace. We are looking forward to the timely and effective implementation of\\nthe recently agreed Afghanistan-Pakistan Action Plan for Peace and Solidarity.\\nAll stakeholders need to agree to treat all shades of terrorism as one, shut down the breeding grounds and sanctuaries and prosecute or repatriate the violators. The response thus far has been sparse and insufficient. We are working with all countries, near and far, to bring about better results. On that basis, Afghanistan stands for the balanced implementation of all four pillars of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, and non-compliance must be seriously addressed as well. My country has also begun a process of structured cooperation with the United Nations Office of Counter- Terrorism, and we are supportive of regional initiatives through forums that focus on such priority concerns. We will continue to engage in work with regional stakeholders in that regard.\\nSince we last met, Afghanistan turned a page and made unprecedented overtures to the Taliban to be part of a credible, Afghan-owned, Afghan-led peace process that could lead to a just and comprehensive political settlement through talks and reconciliation. On several occasions, we have pledged our commitment to unconditional intra-Afghan dialogue and the restoration of all rights and privileges for those who agree to end the cycle of violence. We even announced a unilateral ceasefire earlier this year, which was agreed to by the Taliban for a three-day period and gave Afghans a glimpse of what peace can look and feel like. Unfortunately, extraneous agendas prevented us from replicating a second ceasefire more recently, but we will not rest. We will have to pursue both what is right and attainable.\\nI want to express my sincere thanks to all nations, especially the United States, other concerned nations and parties — including the Governments of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and of Indonesia, both of which recently hosted United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) gatherings — the United Nations and others for  encouraging all  sides to set the stage for a process that would lead to talks and a just and comprehensive negotiated settlement. Looking at the 25-year record, a prerequisite for talks is to learn from the history of peace engagement. We see that a dual approach is necessary to make sure that we win peace, but also protect and preserve our people’s gains and hard-earned achievements, which include constitutional order, freedom of expression, human and gender rights and creating economic opportunities.\\n \\nI want to pause here and pay tribute to Afghans who continue to suffer as a result of violence, as well as to our valiant National Security Forces for their steadfast defence of our nation and for standing tall and strong on the front line against terrorism.\\nThere are two important popular tests on the horizon  for  Afghanistan:  parliamentary  elections are slated for  next month and presidential elections for next year. Drawing on past experiences, both President Ashraf Ghani and I agree that political legitimacy is derived from the will of the people. While we pursue peace efforts and deal with security and governance challenges, we are reminded that, given our circumstances, eventually we must make sure that the electoral process is trustworthy and that the electorate can agree to a fairly credible and legitimate outcome. Regardless of who wins or loses, Afghanistan’s future rests on nurturing a national consensus that provides unity of purpose aimed at peace and political stability that derives legitimacy from foundations that are pluralistic, inclusive and democratic.\\nIn that regard, I wish to  thank  the  United Nations — UNAMA in particular — the European Union and all other contributors and donors for helping us move the process forward. Furthermore, we look forward to the upcoming Geneva ministerial conference on Afghanistan in November. It will be an excellent occasion to evaluate our work and the path ahead since we last met with donors.\\nOn the humanitarian front, Afghanistan also faces daunting tasks associated with an impending drought, refugee resettlement and internal displacement caused by climatic and national abnormalities, food insecurity and security threats. Those are estimated to impact two thirds of the country and the livelihoods of more than 4 million people, with the potential to force 1 million more into migration. We sorely need to attend to their humanitarian needs. I want to thank the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, other United Nations agencies, non-governmental organizations and donors for their contributions and hard work on the ground; however, we urge the international community to fully fund the 2018-2021 Afghanistan humanitarian response plan.\\nThe peaceful settlement of disputes and the protection of oppressed people are core principles of the Charter of the United Nations, benefiting the promotion\\nand preservation of international peace and security. As a war-ravaged country, we sympathize with and feel for the people of Syria, Yemen and other victimized communities around the world. Likewise, we stand for the basic right to protection for the Rohingya population in Myanmar. Afghanistan stands in  full support  of all United Nations and other international efforts aimed at achieving a just, comprehensive and lasting settlement to the question of Palestine, including the General Assembly’s call for an international protection mechanism for civilians.\\nMoreover, United Nations peacebuilding activities should provide due focus on the principle of national ownership, the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the promotion of greater coherence among the relevant United Nations entities and agencies working on development.\\nWith regard to the reform agenda, we stand in full support of efforts aimed at strengthening the role of the United Nations in the context of the Secretary-General’s initiatives. The establishment of the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs is a welcome move, as is the setting up of the Office of Counter- Terrorism. We look  forward  to  the  implementation of the resolution adopted on the repositioning of the United Nations development system and believe it will enhance our achievements in the establishment of One UN for Afghanistan.\\nAfghanistan’s active role within the United Nations system is currently more pronounced than ever. Our chairmanship of the Third Committee during the seventy- third session comes at a crucial time, as we have aimed to initiate and adopt several draft resolutions on shared themes, including victims of terrorism and the threat of improvised explosive devices, in addition to refugee and migrant issues, the rights of children, women’s empowerment, human rights, social development and other relevant Committee agenda items.\\nFurthermore, Afghanistan’s election to the Human Rights Council for the first time in 2017 marked our commitment and showcased our achievements in that regard. We remain party to major international protocols and conventions on human rights. I am pleased to inform the Assembly that Afghanistan recently passed a set of national laws on prohibiting cruel and degrading treatment, endorsed the law on prohibiting torture and combating human and migrant trafficking and adopted a code prohibiting child recruitment into our security\\n \\nforces. With regard to the latter, we are working closely with the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict.\\nI want to leave this rostrum by presenting a bold concept, also recently mentioned by President Ghani, that can form a new, visionary paradigm for my country and our region as we strive to end four decades of conflict and enter a new phase free of violence and the forced implementation of  stagnant ideas and spoiler habits. It is a  concept that dwells  on  Afghanistan becoming a platform of cordiality for regional and hemispheric cooperation over the next few years, in sharp contrast to being pushed and pulled towards becoming an area of instability and confrontation.\\nOur people, who pose no danger to anyone, are demanding a fundamental change in which they can play a constructive and collaborative role across boundaries and help turn their country into a roundabout of people, goods, services, communications, cooperation and ideas across the wider region. I believe that, with the help of the international community, we can turn this concept into a reality. I hope to further engage our regional partners in helping us bring this vision to fruition. I hope that the Assembly and all concerned Member States will play a supportive and positive role to put an end to years of agony and open up a new path leading to durable peace, stability and prosperity.\\n'"

       "['It is an honour to be present at the General Assembly today. It is wonderful to be here in the great city of New York. Once again this week, New Yorkers showed us how to be resilient and resolute in the face of violent extremism. On behalf of everyone in this Hall, let me directly say to the people of New York that they are a model to the rest of the world, and we thank them.\\nExactly one year ago, Canada was in the middle of a long — 78 days on the road, and I can assure the Assembly that, in Canada, there are 78 days’ worth of roads — and closely fought election campaign. It is the responsibility of a leader to spend time with the people they are elected to serve. To get the real stories, it is important to go where people live: coffee shops and church basements, mosques and synagogues, farmers’ markets and public parks. It was in those places that I got the best sense of what Canadians were thinking and how they were doing and, through the politeness — because we Canadians are always polite even when we are complaining — I learned a few things.\\nI talked with people my age who were trying to be hopeful about their future but found it tough to make ends meet, even when they were working full-time. I heard from young Canadians who were frustrated, who told me that they could not get a job because they do not have work experience but they cannot get work experience because they do not have a job. I heard from women and girls who still face inequality in the workplace and violence just because they are women, even in a progressive country like Canada.\\nI met parents who were working hard to give their children every opportunity to succeed but who feared that their efforts would not be sufficient. I had the chance share a meal with elderly retirees who had toiled all their lives but who now have to go to food banks. Over the past few years, I have had far too many disturbing conversations with Canadians, but they made something clear to me. Canadians still believe in progress, or, at least, that progress is possible. But that optimism is mixed with great concern. It is clear that Canadians are not the only ones who feel that way; those feelings are present everywhere. That anxiety is a fact of life.\\nWhen leaders are faced with citizens’ anxiety, we have a choice to make. Do we exploit that anxiety or do we allay it? Exploiting it is easy, but in order to allay it we need to be prepared to answer some very direct questions. What will create the good, well-paying jobs that people want and need and deserve? What will strengthen and grow the middle class and help those working hard to join it? What will build an economy that works for everyone? What will help to make the world a safer, more peaceful place?\\nTo allay people’s anxiety, we need to create economic growth that is broadly shared, because a fair and successful world is a peaceful one. We need to focus on what brings us together, not on what divides us. For Canada, that means re-engaging in global affairs through institutions like the United Nations. It does not serve our interests — or the world’s — to pretend that we are not deeply affected by what happens beyond our borders.\\nEarlier this year, we helped negotiate the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. As part of our commitment to implementing that Agreement, we announced that Canada would invest $2.65 billion over five years to fund clean, low-carbon growth in developing countries. In order to help promote peace and security in areas affected by instability, we reaffirmed our support for NATO and committed ourselves to expanding Canada’s role in United Nations peacekeeping operations. We hosted the fifth Replenishment Conference of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, where we increased our contribution by 20 per cent by giving more than $800 million to the Global Fund. We also encouraged our partners to increase their contributions, making it possible to raise $13 billion in support of ending AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria by 2030.\\nWe have done all this — and will do much more — because we believe we should confront anxiety with a clear plan to deal with its root causes. We believe we should bring people together around shared purposes such as the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. What is the alternative? Is it to exploit anxiety? Is it to turn it into fear and blame? Is it to reject others because they look or speak or pray differently than we do?\\nIn Canada we got a very important thing right — not perfect, but right. In Canada, we see diversity as a source of strength, not weakness. Our country is strong not in spite of our differences, but because of them. We must make no mistake: we have had many failures, from the internment of Ukrainian, Japanese and Italian Canadians during the World Wars, to our turning away of boats of Jewish and Punjabi refugees, to the shamefully continuing marginalization of indigenous peoples. What matters is that we learn from our mistakes and recommit ourselves to doing better. To that end, in recent months, Canadians have opened their hearts and their arms to families fleeing the ongoing conflict in Syria, and from the moment they arrived, those 31,000 refugees were welcomed — not as burdens, but as neighbours and friends — as new Canadians.\\nThat effort has brought Canadians together. In an almost unprecedented fashion, the Government has worked with the business community, engaged citizens and civil society to help the newcomers adapt to their new country. But our efforts will not truly be successful until those refugees have become established, full- fledged members of the Canadian middle class. I want the General Assembly to know that this objective is within our grasp — not because of what we have done, but because of what they are themselves.\\nRefugees are people with the same hopes and dreams as our own citizens. But while our people have felt anxiety, Syrians faced catastrophe. We all know where Syria’s middle class is: they are living in refugee camps in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. They are moving across Europe, looking for a place to set down roots, to get their kids back into school, to find steady work and to become productive citizens. Refugee camps are teeming with Syria’s middle class: doctors and lawyers, teachers and entrepreneurs. They are well educated. They work hard. They care about their families. They want a better life — a safer and more secure future for their kids — as we all do. When I say, therefore, that I hope that the Syrian refugees we welcomed will soon be able to join our middle class, I am confident that we can make that happen, and we will do it by offering to them the same things we offer to all our citizens — a real and fair chance at success for everyone.\\nWe are going to do all we can to build a strong middle class in Canada. We are going to invest in education, because it gives the next generation the tools they need to contribute to the world economy and to succeed. We are going to invest in infrastructure because it creates good, well-paying jobs for the middle class and helps to make our communities better places to live, work and invest. We are determined to build an economy that works for everyone — not just the wealthiest 1 per cent — so that every person benefits from economic growth. And we are going to refuse to give in to the pressure of trading our cherished values for easy votes. The world expects better from us, and we expect better from ourselves.\\nIn the end, there is a choice to be made. Strong, diverse, resilient countries like Canada did not happen by accident, and they will not continue without effort. Every single day, we need to choose hope over fear and diversity over division. Fear has never created a single job or fed a single family, and those who exploit it will never solve the problems that have created such anxiety. Our citizens, the nearly 7.5 billion people we collectively serve, are better than the cynics and pessimists think they are. People want their problems solved, not exploited.\\nCanada is a modest country. We know we cannot solve these problems alone. We know we need to do this all together. We know it will be hard work. But we are Canadian, and we are here to help.\\n',\n",
       " 'It is always an honour for me to address the General Assembly. It is also a responsibility — above all given the serious and worrying situation in the world. I stand before those present on behalf of France to issue several appeals. First, I would like to ask all members to do everything possible to implement the historic Agreement that was signed in Paris on 12 December 2015. The Agreement was historic because the conference was held at a time when Paris, the capital of France, had been struck by terrorist attacks. The Agreement was historic because, for the first time, the assembled international community agreed to make a commitment to reducing global warming and mobilizing financing, while allowing the most vulnerable countries to make an energy transition.\\nAnd yet, standing before the Assembly, let me state once again that despite the momentous nature of the Agreement, there is no time to lose. The past two years have been the hottest known to humankind since records began. Admittedly, in April 2016, right here with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, an agreement was signed with 175 countries. But everyone here knows that it will come into force only if it is ratified by 55 per cent of countries, representing 55 per cent of greenhouse-gas emissions. The United States and China have announced their decision to ratify, which is very important. Nothing would have been possible without the participation and the commitment of those two countries, which are the largest emitters of carbon dioxide. France itself will notify the United Nations tomorrow that it has completed its ratification procedure. I appeal to all members to speed up their ratification procedures so that the goal is met by the end of the year.\\nThe twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP-21) was a conference of decisions. The twenty-second session, to be held in Marrakech, should be a conference of solutions. It is a question of implementing the International Solar Alliance, fighting desertification, protecting the seas and also setting a carbon price.\\nHowever, the appeal I want to issue to the Assembly, following this climate agreement, is an appeal for Africa. Africa is a continent full of promise, but its development could be hindered by climate change, migration, conflict, war and terrorism. The continent has a bright future; however, it may also be the one to cause growing insecurity, and that insecurity targets, first and foremost, Africans themselves.\\nThat is why, on behalf of France, I am proposing a 2020 agenda for Africa. The plan should make it possible for all Africans to gain access to electricity. Two thirds of Africans today are deprived of it. That is an injustice, but above all it impedes sustainable growth in Africa. What is at stake, therefore, is responding to the needs of 15 per cent of the world population. What is at stake is enabling Africans to benefit from their immense potential for development. What is at issue here is reducing population displacements, that is, migration, which leads to the destabilization of both countries of origin and destination.\\nThat is why, at the Paris Conference, I launched the African Renewable Energy Initiative. Ten donors — and I want thank them here — pledged to donate $10 billion by 2020. France has assumed 20 per cent of that amount, or €2 billion. Europe has decided on an external investment plan, which could reach — still with a view to providing Africans with access to electricity — nearly €40 billion, and even double that amount if European Union member States contribute as well. I call on all countries to join that effort. I am not just calling for solidarity here — for this is a mutual investment that will benefit the whole world — I call for this to happen as soon as possible.\\nBut there will be no development in Africa unless the continent’s security is ensured. When I committed France to acting in Mali, it did so with an awareness of its responsibility. We had to prevent terrorist groups from taking over an entire country and destabilizing an entire region. Today, that threat has been rolled back and Mali is regaining its territorial integrity. But other groups, including Boko Haram and Al-Qaida, are emerging to threaten the security of many countries in West Africa, the Sahel and the Lake Chad region. There too, France is supporting military forces with training, information-sharing and assistance in the fight against terrorism. We are doing so, for instance, in the Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Benin and Cameroon. We should expand such efforts along with the United Nations and the African Union.\\nLet us be clear — the security of Africans has to come from Africans themselves if we want to avoid external intrusion and interference. My appeal for development and renewable energy is also a call for the security of Africans, for equipping their armies and giving them the means to respond, and for these African nations to organize their own development in a free and sovereign manner.\\nThe last call I wish to make here is perhaps the saddest of all. It is for Syria. The Syrian tragedy will go down in history as a disgrace for the international community if we do not end it quickly. Aleppo is today a martyred city, and this is how it shall remain in historical memory. Thousands of children have died in bombings, entire populations are starving, humanitarian convoys are being attacked, and chemical weapons are being used.\\nI have one thing to say in this regard — enough is enough. Just like in February, the ceasefire held for only a few days. It ended practically the day after its announcement, before its terms were even understood. The regime is responsible for its failure and cannot be exonerated for mistakes that could have been made by others. I would say to its foreign supporters — and we all know who they are — that they need to compel the regime’s hand to peace. If they do not then they, alongside the regime, shall bear responsibility for the division and chaos in Syria.\\nThe Security Council must meet as soon as possible. It should not be a theatre of fools — in other words, a place where responsibility can be evaded and where some can impede its work in order to protect a regime while they should be seeking a solution with us. France has four demands. First, we must first impose the ceasefire in line with the decisions that have been taken. That is the precondition. Secondly, we need to ensure the immediate delivery of humanitarian aid to Aleppo and other martyred cities. That is the priority. Thirdly, we must ensure the resumption of political negotiations along the lines of the transition established in 2012. That is the solution. Fourthly, we must sanction the use of chemical weapons. That is justice.\\nIf we take these decisions and act now, there will be a solution for Syria. In fact, it will be more than a solution; there will finally be hope for refugees and displaced persons. There will finally be action that will allow Syria to maintain its territorial integrity. We are also determined to see an intervention in Iraq that will help to free the entire country from the Da’esh occupation of its territory. If we decide to act effectively against terrorism, we can prevent further terrorist attacks around the world. The risk is chaos and division, and it exists beyond Syria. It also exists in Libya. Our priority must be to re-establish the State around the Government of National Accord led by Prime Minister Al-Sarraj — a goal for which France is working with its partners and the United Nations.\\nWe cannot sit back and do nothing. That would be playing into the hands of the forces, terrorists in particular, that aim to destabilize the world. France shall never resign itself, even if it is difficult — especially if it is difficult — and that is why it has taken the initiative to contribute to seeking a solution to the conflict between Israel and Palestine. Of course, no one can impose a solution on the parties, but once again, resigning ourselves to the status quo involves taking a risk. It means allowing settlement to take place once again. It means once again allowing unjust, unfair and unacceptable violence to take place. The objective, therefore, is to meet here at the end of the year and hold a conference at which Israelis and Palestinians can assume their responsibilities to negotiate.\\nThis same spirit led me, along with Chancellor Merkel, to seek a solution in Ukraine. It led to the creation of the Normandy format, which allowed us to come to an agreement in Minsk. Today, we must do everything we can to ensure that the agreement is implemented; if we do not, there will be renewed violence and perhaps even the resumption of war. I recall that this conflict has claimed more than 6,000 victims. I have therefore taken the initiative, along with the Chancellor of Germany, to bring together the Russian and Ukrainian Presidents in the weeks to come to promote progress in the implementation of the Minsk accords.We will not abandon that goal. We will renounce no initiative that we think may be useful.\\nI have raised the issue of terrorism, which threatens every country of the world. Long is the list of all those whom it has impacted in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Europe and even Oceania. No country can claim to be immune to the threat of Islamist terrorism, fundamentalism and fanaticism, which have seduced and radicalized lost individuals within our societies. There is no sea or wall that can protect a country from this tragedy and the scourge of terrorist action, attacks or aggressions. Terrorism thrives on open conflicts that have remained unsolved for too long. It has provoked a wave of refugees and undermined international order, borders that we thought fixed, law that we thought we could maintain and the collective security that was the very principle of the United Nations.\\nIn the face of these dangers, France once again turns to the United Nations. The United Nations has shown its effectiveness with the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which many thought was impossible. United Nations peacekeeping operations have never been as numerous as they are now.\\nHowever, if we want to act to eradicate terrorism, we will need to make decisions and not merely talk of solidarity when a friendly country is attacked or merely express compassion for the victims. We must shoulder responsibilities whenever that can be useful. That is what France does. Not because it is attacked — today, as I have said, every country is a target for terrorism. No, France does it because it is a permanent member of the Security Council and its role is about acting, not creating obstacles. France does it because it has one great idea, the idea that it has upheld throughout its history — bringing freedom, democracy and justice to the world. It is because France puts its policies at the service of a single goal — peace — and talks to everyone involved. It is because France is an independent nation that respects the law and has no enemies other than the forces of hatred and intolerance that use a betrayed religion to create fear. It is because we must fight the populists who exploit distress in order to divide, separate, stigmatize and pit religions against one another, risking confrontations that would have terrible consequences for cohesion in our societies. France is a secular country that proclaims itself as such but that speaks to every religion and guarantees freedom of worship on its soil, because the only interests we have in the world are stability, development and the future of our planet.\\nThat is why France is so committed to the United Nations and demonstrates it every day. I want to pay tribute to the President of the General Assembly, to all who dedicate themselves to the United Nations, beginning with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who for 10 years has led this difficult mission on behalf of all of us and enabled us to advance its cause. And that is also why, in the face of the major challenges I have mentioned, especially Syria and the fight against terrorism, I expect the United Nations, and particularly the Security Council, to shoulder its responsibilities. There comes a moment for every generation and public official when the only question worth asking is whether we have made decisions — and whether they are good decisions. The countries here are all different sizes, at different levels of development and with different sensitivities and beliefs, but they should have only one goal and one demand, which is that the world should rise to the challenges facing the planet.\\nThat is why I want to appeal to all those here — to call for implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, for ensuring that Africa and all Africans have electricity and better development, and for peace in Syria, because it is so urgently needed. That is why I believe in the United Nations, and that is why both France and I are sending a universal message.\\n',\n",
       " 'As I address the General Assembly in this Hall as President for the final time, let me recount the progress that we have made these last eight years. From the depths of the greatest financial crisis of our time, we coordinated our response to avoid further catastrophe and return the global economy to growth. We have taken away terrorist safe havens, strengthened the non-proliferation regime and resolved the Iranian nuclear issue through diplomacy. We opened relations with Cuba, helped Colombia end Latin America’s longest war, and we welcome a democratically elected leader of Myanmar to this Assembly. Our assistance is helping people feed themselves, care for the sick, power communities across Africa and promote models of development rather than dependence. We have made international institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund more representative, while establishing a framework to protect our planet from the ravages of climate change.\\nThis is important work. It has made a real difference in the lives of our people, and it could not have happened had we not worked together. Yet around the globe we are seeing the same forces of global integration that have made us interdependent also expose deep fault lines in the existing international order. We see it in the headlines every day. Around the world, refugees flow across borders in flight from brutal conflict. Financial disruptions continue to weigh upon our workers and entire communities. Across vast swaths of the Middle East, basic security and basic order have broken down. We see too many Governments muzzling journalists, quashing dissent and censoring the flow of information. Terrorist networks use social media to prey upon the minds of our youth, endangering open societies and spurring anger against innocent immigrants and Muslims. Powerful nations contest the constraints placed on them by international law.\\nThis is the paradox that defines our world today. A quarter century after the end of the Cold War, the world is by many measures less violent and more prosperous than ever before, and yet our societies are filled with uncertainty, unease and strife. Despite enormous progress, as people lose trust in institutions, governing becomes more difficult and tensions between nations become more quick to surface.\\nI therefore believe that at this moment we all face a choice. We can choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration, or we can retreat into a world sharply divided, and ultimately in conflict, along age-old lines of nation, tribe, race or religion. I want to suggest today that we must go forward and not backward. I believe that as imperfect as they are, the principles of open markets, accountable governance, democracy, human rights and international law that we have forged remain the firmest foundation for human progress in this century. I make this argument not based on theory or ideology, but on facts — facts that all too often we forget in the immediacy of current events.\\nThis is the most important fact: the integration of our global economy has made life better for billions of men, women and children. Over the last 25 years, the number of people living in extreme poverty has been cut from nearly 40 per cent of humanity to under 10 per cent. That is unprecedented, and it is not an abstraction. It means children have enough to eat; mothers do not die in childbirth.\\nMeanwhile, cracking the genetic code promises to cure diseases that have plagued us for centuries. The Internet can deliver the entirety of human knowledge to a young girl in a remote village on a single hand- held device. In medicine and manufacturing, in education and communications, we are experiencing a transformation of how human beings live on a scale that recalls the revolutions in agriculture and industry. As a result, a person born today is more likely to be healthy, live longer and have access to opportunity than at any time in human history. Moreover, the collapse of colonialism and communism has allowed more people than ever before to live with the freedom to choose their leaders. Despite the real and troubling areas where freedom appears to be in retreat, the fact remains that the number of democracies around the world has nearly doubled in the last 25 years.\\nIn remote corners of the world, citizens are demanding respect for the dignity of all people no matter their gender, race, religion, disability or sexual orientation, and those who deny others dignity are subject to public reproach. An explosion of social media has given ordinary people more ways to express themselves and has raised people’s expectations for those of us in power. Indeed, our international order has been so successful that we take it as a given that great Powers no longer fight world wars, that the end of the Cold War lifted the shadow of nuclear Armageddon, that the battlefields of Europe have been replaced by peaceful union and that China and India remain on a path of remarkable growth.\\nI say all this not to whitewash the challenges we face or to suggest complacency. Rather, I believe that we need to acknowledge these achievements in order to summon the confidence to carry this progress forward and to make sure that we do not abandon those very things that have delivered this progress. In order to move forward, however, we do have to acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction. All too often, those trumpeting the benefits of globalization have ignored inequality within and among nations, have ignored the enduring appeal of ethnic and sectarian identities, and have left international institutions ill-equipped, underfunded and underresourced for handling transnational challenges.\\nAs these real problems have been neglected, alternative visions of the world have pressed forward both in the wealthiest countries and in the poorest: religious fundamentalism, the politics of ethnicity or tribe or sect, aggressive nationalism, a crude populism — sometimes from the far left, but more often from the far right — which seeks to restore what they believe was a better, simpler age free of outside contamination.\\nWe cannot dismiss these visions. They are powerful. They reflect dissatisfaction among too many of our citizens. I do not believe those visions can deliver security or prosperity over the long term, but I do believe that these visions fail to recognize, at a very basic level, our common humanity. Moreover, I believe that the acceleration of travel, technology and telecommunications — together with a global economy that depends on a global supply chain — makes it ultimately self-defeating for those who seek to reverse this progress. Today, a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself.\\nThe answer cannot be a simple rejection of global integration. Instead, we must work together to make sure that the benefits of such integration are broadly shared and that the economic, political and cultural disruptions that are caused by integration are squarely addressed. This is not the place for a detailed policy blueprint, but let me offer in broad strokes those areas where I believe we must do better together.\\nIt starts with making the global economy work better for all people and not just for those at the top. While open markets and capitalism have raised standards of living around the globe, globalization, combined with rapid progress in technology, has also weakened the position of workers and their ability to secure a decent wage. In advanced economies like my own, unions have been undermined and many manufacturing jobs have disappeared. Often, those who benefit most from globalization have used their political power to further undermine the position of workers.\\nIn developing countries, labour organizations have often been suppressed, and the growth of the middle class has been held back by corruption and underinvestment. Mercantilist policies pursued by Governments with export-driven models threaten to undermine the consensus that underpins global trade. Meanwhile, global capital is too often unaccountable — nearly $8 trillion stashed away in tax havens, the shadow banking system that grows beyond the reach of effective oversight.\\nA world in which 1 per cent of humankind controls as much wealth as the other 99 per cent will never be stable. I understand that the gaps between rich and poor are not new, but just as the child in a slum today can see the skyscraper nearby, technology now allows any person with a smartphone to see how the most privileged among us live and the contrast between their own lives and others’. Expectations rise then — faster than Governments can deliver — and a pervasive sense of injustice undermines people’s faith in the system.\\nSo how do we fix this imbalance? We cannot unwind immigration any more than we can stuff technology back into a box. Nor can we look to failed models of the past. If we start resorting to trade wars, market- distorting subsidies, beggar-thy-neighbour policies and overreliance on natural resources instead of innovation, these approaches will make us poor collectively, and they are more likely to lead to conflict. The stark contrast between, say, the success of the Republic of Korea and the wasteland of North Korea shows that the central planned control of the economy is a dead end.\\nBut I do believe there is another path, one that fuels growth and innovation and offers the clearest route to individual opportunity and national success. It does not require succumbing to a soulless capitalism that benefits only the few, but rather recognizes that economies are more successful when we close the gap between rich and poor and growth is broadly based. That means respecting the rights of workers so that they can organize into independent unions and earn a living wage. It means investing in our people, their skills, their education, their capacity to take an idea and turn it into a business. It means strengthening the safety net that protects our people from hardship and allows them to take more risks to look for a new job or start a new venture.\\nThese are the policies that I pursued here in the United States and with clear results. American businesses have now created 15 million new jobs. After the recession, the top 1 per cent of Americans were capturing more than 90 per cent of income growth, but today that is down to roughly half. Last year, poverty in this country fell at the fastest rate in nearly 50 years. With further investment in infrastructure and early childhood education and basic research, I am confident that such progress will continue.\\nSo just as I pursued these measures here at home, so the United States has worked with many nations to curb the excesses of capitalism, not to punish wealth, but to prevent repeated crises that can destroy it. That is why we have worked with other nations to create higher and clearer standards for banking and taxation, because a society that asks less of oligarchs than of ordinary citizens will rot from within.\\nThat is why we have pushed for transparency and cooperation in rooting out corruption and tracking illicit dollars, because markets create more jobs when they are fuelled by hard work and not the capacity to extort and bribe. That is why we have worked to reach trade agreements that raise labour standards and raise environmental standards, as we have done with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, so that the benefits are more broadly shared.\\nJust as we benefit by combating inequality within our countries, so I believe advanced economies still need to do more to close the gap between rich and poor nations around the globe. This is difficult politically. It is difficult to spend on foreign assistance, but I do not believe this is charity. For a small fraction of what we spent on the war in Iraq, we could support institutions so that fragile States do not collapse in the first place and invest in emerging economies that become markets for our goods. It is not just the right thing to do; it is the smart thing to do.\\nThat is why we need to follow through on our efforts to combat climate change. If we do not act boldly, the bill that could come due will be mass migrations, cities submerged, nations displaced, food supplies decimated and conflicts borne of despair. The Paris Agreement on Climate Change gives us a framework to act, but only if we scale up our ambitions. There must be a sense of urgency about bringing the Agreement into force and helping poorer countries leapfrog destructive forms of energy.\\nFor the wealthiest countries, therefore, a green climate fund should be just the beginning. We need to invest in research and provide market incentives to develop new technologies and then make those technologies accessible and affordable for poor countries. Only then can we continue lifting all people up from poverty without condemning our children to a planet beyond their capacity to repair it.\\nWe therefore need new models for the global marketplace, models that are inclusive and sustainable. In the same way, we need models of governance that are inclusive and accountable to ordinary people. I recognize that not every country in this Hall is going to follow the same model of governance. I do not think that America can or should impose our system of government on other countries, but there appears to be a growing contest between authoritarianism and liberalism right now. I want everybody to understand, I am not neutral in that contest. I believe in a liberal political order, an order built not just through elections and representative government, but also through respect for human rights and civil society and independent judiciaries and the rule of law.\\nI know that some countries that now recognize the power of free markets still reject the model of free societies. Perhaps those of us who have been promoting democracy feel somewhat discouraged since the end of the cold war, because we have learned that liberal democracy will not just wash across the globe in a single wave. It turns out that building accountable institutions is hard work, the work of generations. The gains are often fragile. Sometimes we take one step forward and then two steps back. In countries held together by borders drawn by colonial Powers, with ethnic enclaves and tribal divisions, politics and elections can sometimes appear to be a zero-sum game.\\nSo, given the difficulty in forging true democracy in the face of these pressures, it is no surprise that some argue that the future favours the strong man, a top-down model, rather than strong democratic institutions. But I believe this thinking is wrong. I believe that the road of true democracy remains the better path. I believe that, in the twenty-first century, economies can only grow to a certain point until they need to open up, because entrepreneurs need to access information in order to invent, young people need a global education in order to thrive, independent media needs to check the abuses of power. Without this evolution, the expectations of people will ultimately not be met. Suppression and stagnation will set in. And history shows that strong men are then left with two paths: permanent crackdown, which sparks strife at home, or scapegoating enemies abroad, which can lead to war.\\nI will admit that my belief that Governments should serve the individual and not the other way around is shaped by America’s story. Our nation began with the promise of freedom that applied only to the few, but because of our democratic Constitution, because of our Bill of Rights, because of our ideals, ordinary people were able to organize and march and protest. And ultimately those ideals won out and opened doors for women, minorities and workers in ways that made our economy more productive and turned our diversity into a strength. It gave innovators the chance to transform every area of human endeavour. It made it possible for someone like me to be elected President of the United States.\\nSo, yes, my views are shaped by the specific experiences of America, but I do not think this story is unique to America. Look at the transformation that has taken place in countries as different as Japan, Chile, Indonesia and Botswana. The countries that have succeeded are ones in which people feel they have a stake. In Europe, the progress of those countries in the former Soviet bloc that embraced democracy stand in clear contrast to those that did not. After all, the people of Ukraine did not take to the streets because of some plot imposed from abroad. They took to the streets because their leadership was for sale and they had no recourse. They demanded change because they saw life get better for the people in the Baltics and in Poland, societies that were more liberal and democratic and open than their own.\\nSo those of us who believe in democracy need to speak out forcefully because both the facts and history, I believe, are on our side. That does not mean that democracies are not without flaws. It does mean that the cure for what ails our democracies is greater engagement by our citizens, not less. Yes, in America, there is too much money in politics, too much entrenched partisanship, too little participation by citizens, in part because of a patchwork of laws that makes it harder to vote.\\nIn Europe, a well-intentioned Brussels often became too isolated from the normal push-and-pull of national politics. Too often in capitals decision-makers have forgotten that democracy needs to be driven by civic engagement from the bottom up, not governance by experts from the top down. So these are real problems. As leaders of democratic Governments make the case for democracy abroad, we had better strive harder to set a better example at home.\\nMoreover, every country will organize its Government informed by centuries of history, the circumstances of geography and the deeply held beliefs of its people. So I recognize that a traditional society may value unity and cohesion more than a diverse country like my own, which was founded upon what at the time was a radical idea, the idea of the liberty of individual human beings endowed with certain God-given rights. But that does not mean that ordinary people in Asia or Africa or the Middle East somehow prefer arbitrary rule that denies them a voice in the decisions that can shape their lives. I believe that spirit is universal. If anyone doubts the universality of that desire, listen to the voices of young people everywhere who call out for freedom and dignity and the opportunity to control their own lives.\\nThis leads me to the third thing we need to do. We must reject any forms of fundamentalism or racism or belief in ethnic superiority that makes our traditional identities irreconcilable with modernity. Instead, we need to embrace the tolerance that results from respect for all human beings. It is a truism that global integration has led to a collision of cultures. Trade, migration, the Internet — all these things can challenge and unsettle our most cherished identities. We see liberal societies express opposition when women choose to cover themselves. We see protests responding to Western newspaper cartoons that caricature the Prophet Mohammed.\\nIn a world that left the age of empire behind, we see Russia attempting to recover lost glory through force. Asian powers debate competing claims of history. And in Europe and the United States, we see people wrestle with concerns about immigration and changing demographics, suggesting that somehow people who look different are corrupting the character of our countries. There is no easy answer for resolving all these social forces, and we must respect the meaning that people draw from their own traditions, from their religion, from their ethnicity, from their sense of nationhood. But I do not believe progress is possible if our desire to preserve our identities gives way to an impulse to dehumanize or dominate another group.\\nIf our religion leads us to persecute those of another faith, if we jail or beat people who are gay, if our traditions lead us to prevent girls from going to school, if we discriminate on the basis of race, tribe or ethnicity, then the fragile bonds of civilization will fray. The world is too small. We are too packed together for us to be able to resort to those old ways of thinking.\\nWe see this mindset in too many parts of the Middle East. So much of the collapse in order there has been fuelled because leaders sought legitimacy, not because of policies or programmes, but by resorting to persecuting political opposition, or demonizing other religious sects, by narrowing the public space to the mosque, where in too many places perversions of a great faith were tolerated. And these forces built up for years. They are now at work helping to fuel both Syria’s tragic civil war and the mindless medieval menace of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). The mindset of sectarianism, extremism, blood-letting and retribution that has been taking place will not be quickly reversed. If we are honest, we will understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long. But I do believe we have to be honest about the nature of these conflicts. Our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy. And there is a military component to that, which means being united and relentless in destroying networks like ISIL, which show no respect for human life. But it also means that in a place like Syria, where there is no ultimate military victory to be won, we are going to have to pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence, deliver aid to those in need, and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.\\nAcross the region’s conflicts, we have to insist that all parties recognize a common humanity and that nations end proxy wars that fuel disorder, because until basic questions are answered about how communities coexist, the embers of extremism will continue to burn, countless human beings will suffer — most of all in that region — and extremism will continue to be exported overseas. And the world is too small for us to simply be able to build a wall and prevent it from affecting our own societies.\\nAnd what is true in the Middle East is true for all of us. Surely religious traditions can be honoured and upheld while teaching young people science and math, rather than intolerance. Surely we can sustain our unique traditions while giving women their full and rightful role in the politics and economics of a nation. Surely we can rally our nations to solidarity while recognizing equal treatment for all communities — whether it is a religious minority in Myanmar or an ethnic minority in Burundi or a racial minority right here in the United States. And surely, Israelis and Palestinians will be better off if Palestinians reject incitement and recognize the legitimacy of Israel, and Israel recognizes that it cannot permanently occupy and settle Palestinian land. We all have to do better as leaders in tamping down, rather than encouraging, a notion of identity that leads us to diminish others.\\nAnd this leads me to the fourth and final thing we need to do, and that is sustain our commitment to international cooperation rooted in the rights and responsibilities of nations. As President of the United States, I know that for most of human history, power has not been unipolar. The end of the Cold War may have led too many to forget this truth. I have noticed as President that, at times, both America’s adversaries and some of our allies believe that all problems were either caused by Washington or could be solved by Washington, and perhaps too many in Washington believed that as well.\\nBut I believe that America has been a rare super- Power in human history insofar as it has been willing to think beyond narrow self-interest, that while we have made our share of mistakes over these last 25 years – and I have acknowledged some – we have strived, sometimes at great sacrifice, to align better our actions with our ideals. And as a consequence, I believe we have been a force for good.\\nWe have secured allies. We have acted to protect the vulnerable. We have supported human rights and welcomed scrutiny of our own actions. We have bound our power to international laws and institutions. When we have made mistakes, we have tried to acknowledge them. We have worked to roll back poverty, hunger and disease beyond our borders, not just within our borders.\\nI am proud of that. But I also know that we cannot do this alone. And I believe that if we are to meet the challenges of this century, we are all going to have to do more to build up international capacity. We cannot escape the prospect of nuclear war unless we all commit to stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and pursuing a world without them. When Iran agrees to accept constraints on its nuclear programme, that enhances global security and enhances Iran’s ability to work with other nations. On the other hand, when North Korea tests a bomb that endangers all of us. And any country that breaks this basic bargain must face consequences. And those nations with these weapons, like the United States, have a unique responsibility to pursue the path of reducing our stockpiles and reaffirming basic norms, like the commitment to never test them again.\\nWe cannot combat a disease like zika that recognizes no borders – mosquitos do not respect walls – unless we make permanent the same urgency that we brought to bear against Ebola – by strengthening our own systems of public health, by investing in cures, rolling back the root causes of disease and helping poorer countries develop their public health infrastructures.\\nWe can only eliminate extreme poverty if the Sustainable Development Goals that we have set are more than words on paper. Human ingenuity now gives us the capacity to feed the hungry and give all of our children – including our girls – the education that is the foundation for opportunity in our world. But we have to put our money where our mouths are. And we can only realize the promise of this institution’s founding – to replace the ravages of war with cooperation – if powerful nations like my own accept constraints. Sometimes I am criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions. But I am convinced that in the long run, giving up some freedom of action – not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests, but binding ourselves to international rules over the long term – enhances our security. And I think that is not true just for us.\\nIf Russia continues to interfere in the affairs of its neighbours, it may be popular at home and it may fuel nationalist fervour for a time, but over time it is also going to diminish its stature and make its borders less secure. In the South China Sea, a peaceful resolution of disputes offered by law will mean far greater stability than the militarization of a few rocks and reefs.\\nWe are all stakeholders in this international system, and it calls upon all of us to invest in the success of institutions to which we belong. And the good news is that many nations have shown what kind of progress is possible when we make those commitments. Consider what we have accomplished at the United Nations over the past few years. Together, we mobilized some 50,000 additional troops for United Nations peacekeeping, making them nimble, better equipped, better prepared to deal with emergencies. Together we established an Open Government Partnership so that, increasingly, transparency empowers more and more people around the globe. And together, now, we have to open our hearts and do more to help refugees who are desperate for a home.\\nWe should all welcome the pledges of increased assistance that have been made at this General Assembly gathering. I will be discussing that more this afternoon, but we have to follow through, even when the politics are hard, because, in the eyes of innocent men and women and children who, through no fault of their own, have had to flee everything that they know, everything that they love, we have to have the empathy to see ourselves. We have to imagine what it would be like for our family, for our children, if the unspeakable happened to us. And we should all understand that, ultimately, our world will be more secure if we are prepared to help those in need and the nations that are carrying the largest burden with respect to accommodating these refugees.\\nThere are a lot of nations right now that are doing the right thing, but many nations — particularly those blessed with wealth and the benefits of geography — that can do more to offer a hand, even if they also insist that refugees who come to our countries have to do more to adapt to the customs and conventions of the communities that are now providing them a home.\\nLet me conclude by saying that I recognize that history tells a different story than the one that I have talked about here today. There is a much darker and more cynical view of history that we can adopt. Human beings are too often motivated by greed and by power. Big countries for most of history have pushed smaller ones around. Tribes, ethnic groups and nation States have very often found it most convenient to define themselves by what they hate and not just those ideas that bind them together.\\nTime and again, human beings have believed that they finally arrived at a period of enlightenment only to then repeat cycles of conflict and suffering. Perhaps that is our fate. We have to remember that the choices of individual human beings led to repeated world war, but we also have to remember that the choices of individual human beings created the United Nations so that a war like that would never happen again. Each of us as leaders and each nation can choose to reject those who appeal to our worst impulses and embrace those who appeal to our best, for we have shown that we can choose a better history.\\nSitting in a prison cell, a young Martin Luther King, Jr., wrote:\\n“Human progress never rolls on the wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to be co-workers with God.”\\nAnd during the course of these eight years, as I have travelled to many nations represented here, I have seen that spirit in our young people, who are more educated and more tolerant, more inclusive, more diverse and more creative than our generation; who are more empathetic and compassionate towards their fellow human beings than previous generations. And, yes, some of that comes with the idealism of youth, but it also comes with young people’s access to information about other peoples and places — an understanding unique in human history that their future is bound with the fates of other human beings on the other side of the world.\\nI think of the thousands of health-care workers from around the world who volunteered to fight Ebola. I remember the young entrepreneurs I met who are now starting new businesses in Cuba, or the parliamentarians who used to be just a few years ago political prisoners in Myanmar. I think of the girls who have braved taunts or violence just to go to school in Afghanistan, and the university students who started programmes online to reject the extremism of organizations like ISIL. I draw strength from the young Americans — entrepreneurs, activists, soldiers, new citizens — who are remaking our nation once again, and who are unconstrained by old habits and old conventions and unencumbered by what is, but are instead ready to seize what ought to be.\\nMy own family is made up of the flesh and blood and traditions and cultures and faiths from a lot of different parts of the world — just as America has been built by immigrants from every shore. And in my own life in this country, and as President, I have learned that our identities do not have to be defined by putting someone else down, but can be enhanced by lifting somebody else up. They do not have to be defined in opposition to others, but rather by a belief in liberty and equality and justice and fairness.\\nAnd the embrace of these principles as universal does not weaken my particular pride in or my particular love for America — it strengthens it. My belief that these ideals apply everywhere does not lessen my commitment to helping those who look like me, or pray as I do, or pledge allegiance to my flag. But my faith in those principles does force me to expand my moral imagination and to recognize that I can best serve my own people and I can best look after my own daughters by making sure that my actions seek what is right for all people and all children, and other people’s daughters and sons.\\nThis is what I believe — that all of us can be co-workers with God. And our leadership, and our Governments, and the United Nations should reflect this irreducible truth.\\n',\n",
       " 'It is a great honour for me to address the General Assembly for the first time and to do so as Prime Minister of a country that has always been a proud and proactive member at the very heart of the United Nations.\\nThe United Nations was formed because leaders across the world knew that they could deliver security for their citizens at home only if they could cooperate as a community of nations to deliver security across the globe. Some of the threats that we face together today are familiar to those founding leaders: war, political instability, abuses of human rights and poverty. Others are new: global terrorism, climate change and unprecedented mass movements of people.\\nWe gather here today because we know that such challenges do not respect the borders of our individual nations and that only by working together shall we overcome them. As a new Prime Minister to the United Kingdom, my pledge to the United Nations is simple. The United Kingdom will be a confident, strong and dependable partner internationally, true to the universal values that we share together. We will continue to honour our commitment to spend 0.7 of our gross national income on development, building on the achievements that we have already made to reduce poverty, deal with instability and increase prosperity the world over, and we will drive forward the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.\\nWe will continue to champion the rights of women and girls, making sure that all girls get the education they deserve and tackling horrific abuses such as female genital mutilation and the use of sexual violence in conflict. We will continue to be a steadfast permanent member of the Security Council, meeting our NATO commitment to spend 2 per cent of gross domestic product on defence and making a leading contribution to United Nations peacekeeping efforts, where we have doubled our commitment, including new deployments to Somalia and South Sudan.\\nWe will continue to stand up for the rules-based international system and for international law, and I join other leaders in condemning the outrageous bombing of the aid convoy in Syria yesterday. We will continue to play our part in the international effort against climate change, and, in a demonstration of our commitment to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the United Kingdom will start its domestic procedures to enable ratification of the Paris Agreement and complete these before the end of the year. And we will continue to strengthen our existing partnerships, from the United Nations to the Commonwealth and to NATO, seeking to resolve conflict in countries across the world, from Colombia and Cyprus to Somalia and Yemen.\\nBut we must never forget that we stand here at the United Nations as servants of the men and women that we represent back at home. As we do so, we must recognize that for too many of these men and women, the increasing pace of globalization has left them feeling left behind. The challenge for those of us in this Hall is to ensure that our Governments and our global institutions such as the United Nations remain responsive to the people we serve, and that we are capable of adapting our institutions to the demands of the twenty-first century and of ensuring that they do not become irrelevant.\\nSo when it comes the big security and human rights challenges of our time, we need this, our United Nations, to forge a bold new multilateralism, because, as we have seen even in the past week, no country is untouched by the threat of global terrorism, and when extremists anywhere in the world can transmit their poisonous ideologies directly into the bedrooms of people vulnerable to radicalization, we need not just work together to prevent conflict and instability in nation States, but to act globally to disrupt the networks that terrorist groups use to finance operations and recruit to their ranks.\\nWhen we see the mass displacement of people on a scale unprecedented in recent history, we must ensure that we are implementing the policies that are fit for the challenges we face today. And when criminal gangs do not respect our national borders, trafficking our fellow citizens into lives of slavery and servitude, we cannot let those borders act as a barrier to bringing such criminals to justice.\\nIn each of these areas, it is the convening power of our United Nations that gives us a unique opportunity to respond. But we can do so only if we modernize and adapt to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.\\nAs a United Nations we have shown how we can work together to reduce the threat of international terrorism by preventing conflict and instability from developing. For example, as a permanent member of the Security Council, Britain has played a leading role in the fight against Al-Shabaab in Somalia. Since 2010, with huge support from across the region and, critically, the commitment of Somalis themselves, Al-Shabaab has been driven from all the major cities it used to control.\\nIt is vital that as an international community we continue to support countries in the region that are contributing thousands of troops, and that we continue to build the capacity of Somali security forces. That is why the United Kingdom is now going to increase further our security support, and we will be calling on others to do the same, hosting an international conference on Somalia in 2017, to maintain this vital momentum. Missions like this must remain central to the work of the United Nations, but on their own they are not enough, because the terrorist threats we face today do not come from one country but rather exist in a different space. The global networks they exploit require a different kind of global response.\\nThese organizations are using our own modern banking networks against us. We therefore need to look at our regulations and information-sharing and use our technological capabilities to get ahead of them. They are targeting our airlines, exploiting the fact that no one country can keep its citizens safe when they are flying between multiple jurisdictions. That is why this week the United Nations will vote on a United Kingdom- led draft resolution on aviation security so that every country implements the standards we need to ensure that no country is the weak link.\\nThey are exploiting the Internet and social media to spread an ideology that is recruiting people to their cause all over the world. We therefore need to tackle this ideology head-on. That is why the United Kingdom has championed the work that the Secretary-General has led to develop a strategy for preventing violent extremism. Now, as an international community, we must work together to adopt and implement the most comprehensive national action plans to tackle both the causes and the symptoms of all extremism. It is not enough merely to focus on violent extremism. We need to address the whole spectrum of extremism — violent extremism and non-violent extremism, Islamist and neo-Nazi, hate and fear in all their forms.\\nJust as we need the United Nations to modernize to meet the challenges of terrorism in the twenty-first century, so too must we adapt if we are to fashion a truly global response to the mass movements of people across the world and its implications for security and human rights. The 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol must remain the bedrock of our response, but the context in which they must be applied has dramatically changed.\\nAcross the world today, there are 65 million people who have been forcibly displaced. That is the equivalent of the entire population of the United Kingdom. It is an unprecedented figure, one that has almost doubled in a decade. And yet United Nations appeals are underfunded, host countries are not getting enough support and refugees are not getting the aid, education and economic opportunities they need. We must do more. As the second-largest bilateral provider of assistance, the United Kingdom remains fully committed to playing a leading role.\\nIn the past five years, the United Kingdom has invested over $9 billion in humanitarian assistance, saving millions of lives every year. The London Conference on Syria in February raised $12 billion in pledges, the largest amount ever raised in one day in response to a humanitarian crisis. And that money is being used to combine both urgent humanitarian assistance and vital economic development, benefiting both refugees and the communities and countries hosting them. Clearly, we need to continue our efforts to bring an end to the conflict and the appalling slaughter in Syria and to get aid through to those who need it.\\nWhile these efforts continue inside Syria, we also need new efforts to support refugees and host communities in neighbouring countries, including through education and opportunities to work. These efforts are complemented by loans from international financial institutions and access to European markets. Through our trading relationships and direct engagement with businesses, we are mobilizing the private sector to create new jobs in the region for everyone. While there is more to be done, it is this approach to financing both humanitarian support and economic development that I will be championing when I announce a further United Kingdom financial contribution at President Obama’s leaders’ summit on the global refugee crisis later today.\\nBut in addition to refugees and displaced people fleeing conflict and persecution, we are also seeing an unprecedented movement of people in search of greater economic opportunities through the same unmanaged channels. That affects all of us, and it is the responsibility of us all to take action. We cannot ignore the challenge or allow it to continue unmanaged. We need to do better — for the countries people leave, for the countries they move through, for the countries they try to get to — and most of all, better for the migrants and refugees themselves.\\nDespite the huge increase in international efforts, more migrants have died attempting hazardous journeys across borders this year than any other. I believe we have to use the opportunity afforded by this session of the General Assembly for an honest global debate to address this global challenge.\\nIn doing so, we should be clear that there is nothing wrong with the desire to migrate for a better life and that controlled, legal, safe, economic migration brings benefits to our economies. But countries have to be able to exercise control over their borders. The failure to do so erodes public confidence, fuels international crime, damages economies and reduces the resources for those who genuinely need protection and whose rights under the Refugee Convention should always be fulfilled. I believe there are three fundamental principles that we now need to establish at the heart of a new approach to managing migration that is in the interests of all those involved.\\nFirst of all, we must help ensure that refugees claim asylum in the first safe country they reach. The current trend of onward movements, where refugees reach a safe country but then press on with their journey, can only benefit criminal gangs and expose refugees to grave danger. We must therefore all do more to support countries where the refugees first arrive, to provide the necessary protection and assistance for refugees safely and swiftly and to help countries adapt to the huge economic impact that refugees can have — including on their existing population.\\nAs we are seeing in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, when the right assistance is provided, solutions that provide sanctuary and opportunity to refugees, and opportunities for those hosting them, can be found. This is also good for the refugees and the countries they come from — because the closer they stay to home, the easier it will be for them to return and rebuild after the conflict.\\nSecondly, we need to improve the ways we distinguish between refugees fleeing persecution and economic migrants. I believe we must ensure that the existing Convention and Protocol are properly applied to provide protection to refugees and reduce the incentives for economic migrants to use illegal routes. This in turn will help us target support for those refugees who need it most and retain the support of our populations for doing so.\\nThirdly, we need a better overall approach to managing economic migration — one that recognizes that all countries have the right to control their borders — and that we must all commit to accepting the return of our own nationals when they have no right to remain elsewhere. By ensuring a managed and controlled international migration response while simultaneously investing to tackle the underlying drivers of displacement and migration at source, we can reject isolationism and xenophobia, thereby achieving better outcomes for all of our citizens, particularly for the most vulnerable.\\nFinally, as we gather here today to bring the founding values of the United Nations to bear on some of the most pressing global problems, the likes of which we have never seen before, we must also face up to the fact that some of the worst human rights abuses, which we thought we had consigned to the history books, have re-emerged in new, pernicious forms. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, proclaimed by the General Assembly, stated that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, that no one should be held in slavery and servitude and that slavery and the slave trade should be prohibited in all their forms. Yet, nearly 70 years on, we are presented with a new form of slavery — modern slavery. Organized crime groups, which are largely behind this modern slavery, lure, dupe and force innocent men, women and children into extreme forms of exploitation. Trafficked and sold across borders, victims are forced into living the kind of inhumane existence that is almost too much for our imagination.\\nSuch criminals have global networks to help them make money out of some of the world’s most vulnerable people. Victims are held captive in squalid conditions, under the constant shadow of violence and forced into sex and labour exploitation. If we are going to succeed in stamping out this abhorrent crime and bring the perpetrators to justice, we need to confront the reality of what were are dealing with. These organized- crime groups work across borders and jurisdictions. They often use the Internet and modern technology to recruit, transport, control and exploit their victims, all the while staying ahead of legal systems that are often constrained by traditional geographical boundaries.\\nWe must therefore take action. We must use our international law-enforcement networks to track down these criminals wherever they are in the world and put them behind bars, where they belong. We need to be smarter and even more coordinated than the criminal gangs in our efforts to stop them. In the United Kingdom, I am setting up the first-ever Government task force for modern slavery, bringing together every relevant department to coordinate and drive all our efforts in the battle against this cruel exploitation. We are also using our aid budget to create a dedicated fund focused on high-risk countries where we know victims are regularly trafficked to the United Kingdom. Yesterday, I committed the first £5 million from that fund to work in Nigeria, to reduce the vulnerability of potential victims and step up the fight against those who seek to profit from this crime.\\nBut if we are to meet the Sustainable Development Goal to eradicate modern slavery, we need to go much further. Security relationships have developed between many countries for dealing with such issues as counter- terrorism, cybersecurity, drug trafficking and wider intelligence-sharing, but we do not have a similar relationship for the fight against modern slavery. We therefore need our law-enforcement agencies to work together, with joint investigation teams working across multiple countries. Victims will find freedom only if we cultivate a radically new, global and coordinated approach to defeating this vile crime. Together, we must work tirelessly to preserve the freedoms and values that have defined our United Nations from its inception. Together, we must work tirelessly to restore these freedoms and values to the lives of the men, women and children who are exploited for profit and held captive with little or no chance of escape.\\nFrom the Declaration of St. James’s Palace and the Atlantic Charter forged by Winston Churchill and President Roosevelt to the first meeting of the General Assembly in London in 1946, the United Kingdom has always been an outward-looking, global partner at the heart of international efforts to secure peace and prosperity for all our peoples. And that is how we will remain. For when the British people voted to leave the European Union, they did not vote to turn inwards or walk away from any of our partners in the world. Faced with challenges like migration, a desire for greater control of their country and a mounting sense that globalization is leaving working people behind, they demanded a politics that is more in touch with their concerns and bold action to address them.\\nBut that action must be more global, not less, because the biggest threats to our prosperity and security do not recognize or respect international borders. And if we focus only on what we do at home, the job is barely half done. This is not the time to turn away from our United Nations. It is the time to turn towards it. Only we, as members of this community of nations, can act to ensure that this great institution becomes as relevant for our future as it has been in our past.\\nLet us therefore come together, true to our founding values but responsive to the challenges of today, and let us work together to build a safer, more prosperous and more humane world for generations to come.\\n']"
