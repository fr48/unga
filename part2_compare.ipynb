    "On the international stage, there are two visions of the Internet: one that sees the Internet as open and free for all ideas, and the other that sees the Internet that should be restricted to within their boundaries, to restrict ideas only to \"approved\" ones. The United States and many other Western countries support the idea of an open Internet. Countries that prefer to restrict speech or monitor citizens, such as Russia and China, support what's called the \"sovereign\" Internet.\n",

       "[\"Allow me first to\\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of the\\nGeneral Assembly. Canadians are proud to have\\naccompanied you and your people on their journey to join\\nthe community of nations.\\nOn behalf of Canada, allow me also to welcome the\\nRepublic of Kiribati, the Republic of Nauru and the\\nKingdom of Tonga as new Members of the United Nations.\\n\\nMr. President, your election is a tribute to your\\nwisdom and your dedication to the goals of the United\\nNations. I am convinced that you will guide us well in\\ncarrying out the work that we are gathered here to do on\\nbehalf of all of the world's people.\\n\\nIndeed, it is we the people for whom the United\\nNations was founded and its purposes forged. We the\\npeople, not we the nation States, or the ministers, or the\\nambassadors, or the Secretariat. Let us recall these lines\\nfrom the United Nations Charter:\\n“We the peoples of the United Nations\\ndetermined to save succeeding generations from the\\nscourge of war, ... to reaffirm faith in fundamental\\nhuman rights, ... to establish conditions under which\\njustice ... can be maintained, and to promote social\\nprogress and better standards of life in larger freedom,\\n... have resolved to combine our efforts to accomplish\\nthese aims”.\\nThese are noble words and compelling goals. But do\\nthey still ring true, or is there a need for new meaning and\\nnew commitment?\\nHow would we the people assess the handiwork of the\\nUnited Nations to date and judge the world scene today\\nwhen we have seen in the last year alone the brutal ethnic\\ncleansing of Kosovo, the slaughter and maiming of\\ninnocents in Sierra Leone, Angola, both Congos and Sudan\\nand the cruel suppression of the independence agreement in\\nEast Timor? Or when we see kidnapping and terrorism\\nplaguing virtually every region, the growing, powerful\\ninfluence of the drug-traffickers and criminals, the return of\\nthe slave merchants and the emergence of modern warlords\\nwho brutalize and exploit communities for economic\\ngain? Or when we are all subject to the darker side of\\nglobalization, where international commerce brings new\\nbut poorly distributed wealth, where helpless children are\\nrecruited into armies or sold on the internet for exploitive\\npurposes, where environmental degradation inflicts a high\\ncost on the smallest countries, which can least afford it?\\nOur world on the eve of the millennium is\\nincreasingly shaped by these and a variety of other direct\\nthreats to people. If we the peoples were to have the\\nchance to rethink the Preamble to the Charter, we might\\nwell say that we are determined to save existing\\ngenerations from the grave new risks to their personal and\\nfamily security.\\nIt is true that there is another perspective, one that\\ngives a glimmer of hope. We could point with some\\nsatisfaction to the fact that, through the combined efforts\\nof people working together across borders, there is an\\nemerging sense of accomplishment in responding to these\\nnew threats to human security.\\nAs of today, 86 nations have ratified the Convention\\non antipersonnel mines, ushering in a legal regime and a\\nplan of action that will save the lives of thousands.\\nWorking together last year, 120 nations voted in\\nfavour of an International Criminal Court, which will\\nestablish individual accountability for crimes against\\nhumanity.\\nIn the field of conflict, the United Nations is now\\nattempting to rebuild the broken fields of Kosovo after an\\nunprecedented intervention for humanitarian reasons. And\\nin East Timor, peacekeepers are bringing order to that\\nlong-troubled land.\\nSo we the peoples have not given up in the face of\\nthe confusion, turmoil and misery which beset our world;\\nand we still search through the corridors of this building\\nfor words of cooperation and acts of consensus.\\n(spoke in French)\\nBut it is not easy, because many forget that it is we\\nthe peoples, all the world's people, whom we are here to\\nserve, not just their particular national interests. Too many\\nprotect their prerogatives, engage in exclusive power\\npolitics or refuse to pay their bills, thereby paralysing the\\ninstitution and rendering it incapable of meeting the\\nchallenges to our collective well-being.\\n16\\n\\n\\nIt is difficult to promote an agenda for the security of\\npeople when some stand opposed, on the basis of a desire\\nto protect at all costs the sovereignty of the State. Of\\ncourse, State sovereignty remains a fundamental tenet of\\npeace and security; but it is not absolute, and it is not a\\nshield behind which the most egregious violations of human\\nrights and fundamental freedoms can be hidden.\\nIt is time, therefore, for we the peoples represented in\\nthis Assembly to reassess our influence and make our\\nvoices heard.\\n(spoke in English)\\nThere is a new road map to lead the way. Last week\\nthe Secretary-General tabled a report on the protection of\\ncivilians in armed conflict (S/1999/957) in which he\\ncaptures many of today's challenges and sets out 40\\nrecommendations for action.\\nThe heaviest burden falls on the Security Council. The\\nsearch for global peace increasingly turns on issues of\\npersonal safety. Modern conflict takes a huge,\\ndisproportionate toll on civilians. In this world, the\\nprotection of civilians must be central to the Council's\\nwork. It must provide the subtext for our future collective\\naction and the impetus behind our efforts to prevent\\nconflict, keep the peace, enforce sanctions and support the\\ncollective will of the United Nations.\\nThe way ahead is not without obstacles. There are\\nlegitimate questions about the purposes, limits and\\nstandards for Council engagement for humanitarian ends,\\nwhich itself also present difficult contradictions with regard\\nto the principle of non-interference. Clear and consistent\\ncriteria are needed against which the necessity or otherwise\\nof humanitarian intervention — including enforcement —\\ncan be judged and applied. These tests must be very\\ndemanding: the basis must be the existence of fundamental\\nbreaches of international humanitarian and human rights\\nlaw.\\nThe human dimension makes it imperative that the\\nCouncil adapt the blunt instrument of sanctions into a\\ntargeted tool so that they hurt where they are supposed to\\nhurt. The Council needs also to show the resolve to\\nimplement sanctions once they are in place. This is\\nCanada's objective as chairman of the Council's Angola\\nsanctions Committee established pursuant to resolution 864\\n(1993) — to develop tougher measures to constrain the\\ntrade in arms and diamonds, thereby making it more\\ndifficult for UNITA to wage war. It is time to tackle the\\nnew war economy in which a direct relationship exists\\nbetween certain businesses, mercenaries and warlords, a\\nrelationship that perpetuates misery, conflict and the\\nvictimization of innocent people.\\nA human security agenda highlights the urgent need\\nto face clearly the issue of the Council's representation\\nand its decision-making processes, especially the\\ninappropriate use and persistent threat of the veto where\\nit can compromise, complicate and slow down\\ndetermined, urgent international action to protect people.\\nThe Council needs to come to grips with these challenges\\nif it is to maintain its credibility in the eyes of the people\\nit serves. Membership in the Council is a trust, and\\nCouncil members need to demonstrate their capacity to\\nmaintain that trust.\\nThe issues raised by the Secretary-General in his\\nreport on the protection of civilians in armed conflict are\\nissues that plague all peoples. The Secretary-General's\\nproposals in fact go beyond the purview of just the\\nSecurity Council; the onus for taking action lies with all\\nMember States. For that reason, I strongly urge that the\\nGeneral Assembly should begin consideration of this\\nreport and move quickly to establish mechanisms to give\\neffect to its recommendations, including a system of\\nreporting to review implementation. Towards this end,\\nCanada looks forward to working with the Secretary-\\nGeneral and fellow Member States to establish a “friends\\nof civilians in armed conflict” group to help guide these\\nefforts.\\nTo protect civilians in armed conflict, the Assembly\\nhas the means to enable the United Nations to act more\\nquickly; the moral authority to establish universal\\nstandards that hold us all accountable; and the legitimacy\\nto direct efforts into new areas of global endeavour. The\\nability to respond rapidly when the security of civilians is\\nthreatened is essential. Giving the United Nations a rapid\\nresponse capability — particularly through the creation of\\na United Nations headquarters for rapid deployment —\\nwould be an important step. How much more effective\\ncould the United Nations have been in East Timor or in\\nKosovo if such a capability had existed?\\nThe civilian side of peace operations — the police\\nand the judges, the civil servants and the human rights\\nexperts — is also of growing importance, but insufficient\\ncapacity for rapid deployment is a problem here too.\\nClearly the “White Helmets” are as critical to building\\npeace as the Blue Helmets, and they deserve no less of\\nour attention. Those of us who are able might start by\\n17\\n\\n\\nimproving our respective national capacity to make\\ncontributions to be put at the service of the United Nations.\\nThis is something my Government has begun and is\\nworking to improve. Globally binding humanitarian and\\nhuman rights standards for behaviour and practical\\nmechanisms to hold transgressors accountable would also\\nadvance the security of people subjected to the horrors of\\narmed conflict.\\nThe adoption of the Statute of the International\\nCriminal Court was a qualitative step forward. It will help\\nto end the culture of impunity and protect all people against\\nthe most egregious violations of humanitarian law. The\\nAssembly's priority now should be to bring the Court to\\nlife. This means continued cooperation from us all in\\nbuilding the technical underpinnings of this Court. It also\\nmeans ensuring prompt and widespread ratification of the\\nCourt's Statute.\\nStrengthened standards and strategies are needed\\nelsewhere. For example, negotiating the strongest possible\\noptional protocol on the involvement of children in armed\\nconflict, which should be accompanied by a comprehensive\\naction plan, will help to confront one of the most heinous\\naspects of modern warfare and other conflict.\\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that more must\\nbe done to protect humanitarian workers who risk their\\nlives to help the victims of war. That is why Canada will\\nbe seeking an additional protocol to the Convention on the\\nSafety of United Nations and Associated Personnel to\\nprovide legal protection to all personnel working in\\nsituations of armed conflict, including a broader range of\\nnon-governmental organizations and locally employed\\npersonnel.\\nFinally, the Assembly can direct its efforts towards\\nmaking the safety of people the emphasis in a wider range\\nof global endeavours.\\n(spoke in French)\\nThe greatest threat to human safety remains the\\npossibility of annihilation by nuclear or other weapons of\\nmass destruction. Yet the non-proliferation regime that we\\nhave painstakingly built over the past 50 years remains\\nfragile. We should now ensure that the obligations under\\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons are\\nrespected, and we should implement the Comprehensive\\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and reduce the risk that nuclear\\nweapons pose to our collective security.\\nHuman security is also the impetus behind efforts to\\naddress the problem of small arms, which kill in conflict\\nzones as well as on neighbourhood streets. This is a\\nglobal challenge that requires a global solution. We\\nshould therefore convene a conference on the illicit traffic\\nin small arms, with a comprehensive agenda.\\n(spoke in English)\\nTransnational crime, including the illicit drug trade,\\nterrorism and human smuggling, is a closely related\\nchallenge. It has a direct impact on the safety of all our\\npeople. The conclusion of an effective United Nations\\ntransnational organized crime convention and its protocols\\nwould be a start to providing that protection.\\nTaken together, those efforts would be a strong\\nbeginning to orienting the Assembly to meet the real\\nsecurity needs of people today. I must be very blunt:\\nimprovement in human security is a necessary condition\\nfor success in the other important actions that we take to\\nadvance human, economic, aid and trade development.\\nFarmers cannot work fields strewn with mines. Children\\ncannot learn when they are abused and brutalized by war.\\nInvestors will not send money to regions racked by\\nconflict. Societies cannot flourish when resources are\\npillaged to fuel violence and people are victimized by\\nterror.\\nUltimately, freedom from fear is intimately\\nconnected to the freedom from want. And it is freedom\\nfrom fear for all peoples — which is at the heart of the\\nSecretary-General's report and his recommendations —\\nthat provides the United Nations with a clear, defining\\nrole at the century's close. Our collective efforts towards\\nthat end will give concrete expression to the hopes and\\ndreams of the generation that first made “we the peoples”\\nthe basis for this Organization. Next year's Millennium\\nAssembly and summit offer an opportunity to articulate a\\nvision of the United Nations that places the safety of\\npeople at the centre of its agenda.\\nThe United Nations cannot do it all. The challenges\\nto advancing human safety are complex. Regional\\norganizations play an important role. Practical cooperation\\nbetween countries can address specific problems and the\\nparticipation of members of civil society and non-\\ngovernmental organizations is also imperative. But\\nsecurity for all of us begins and ends with a strong,\\neffective United Nations focused on this goal. We the\\npeoples should resolve to work together to achieve this\\nend.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " 'At the outset, allow me to \\njoin other delegations in congratulating the President \\nof the General Assembly on her election and to express \\nmy deep conviction that, under her skilful leadership, \\nthis session will achieve remarkable results. \\n Allow me also to extend my country’s sentiments \\nof deepest appreciation to Secretary-General Kofi \\nAnnan. His relentless work for a better world has been \\nmost remarkable. Leading the United Nations for 10 \\nyears in very sensitive times, his achievements, \\nhumanism, vision and initiatives have crucially \\ncontributed to the Organization. That has been \\nrecognized worldwide. I wish him all the best in his \\nfuture engagements and thank him. \\n We live in a fragile world — a world disturbed \\nand unsettled, a world that is marked by conflicts, \\ncontroversies and confrontations of an entirely new \\nnature. The architecture and mindsets of yesterday’s \\nworld are giving way to a web of new challenges. \\nYesterday, it was all about blocs, ideologies, the cold \\nwar and appeasement. Today, it is all about ethnicity, \\nconflicts, burning regions, colliding religions, mass \\ndestruction, terror and poverty. \\n Today, international order is marked by three \\nextremely demanding and global challenges: global \\ntensions, global imbalances and global constraints. In \\nthat triangle, we need to strive to deliver sustainable \\nsolutions. Our responsibility is enormous — indeed, \\neven as we seek to ensure global opportunities, \\nfreedom and shared values, this new world in the \\nmaking is in danger of lapsing into mistrust, \\ndisagreements and divisions. \\n We live in a world of extraordinary inequalities in \\nopportunity, but our world is also a global and \\ninterdependent one, where a broad sharing of economic \\nand political opportunities could serve as an effective \\ninstrument for economic growth and development. In \\nso doing, we can start turning the internationally \\nagreed development goals, including the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals, into action. \\n My country is aware that a greater mobilization \\nof domestic resources in developing countries is a \\nnecessity. Croatia has made significant progress in \\ncreating an enabling environment for partnership and \\ninnovation. Tremendous changes have taken place in \\nthe development of a market economy, changing \\nownership structures, creating a business environment, \\nand reforms in the public and private sector. Above all, \\nCroatia has progressed in ensuring domestic \\ndemocratic stability and a prosperous international \\nposition as a framework for long-term development. \\n Croatia supports the commitments to the goals \\nand targets deriving from the United Nations summits \\nin Monterrey and Johannesburg, and the related \\nprocesses, such as the Doha Development Agenda and \\nthe Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. We also \\nsupport the emphasis on achieving the targets in \\ndeveloped countries for official development assistance \\nbased on actual needs — rising from today’s 0.33 per \\ncent of gross national income to at least 0.51 per cent \\nby 2010 and 0.7 per cent by 2015 — to meet the \\nMillennium Development Goals and each country’s \\nabsorption capacity. We recognize that mobilizing \\nfinancial resources for development and the effective \\nuse of those resources in developing countries are \\ncentral to a global partnership for development. \\n Still, simply raising the level of official \\ndevelopment assistance is not enough to enable the \\ninternational community to fulfil its obligations \\ntowards the countries in need. It is also necessary to \\ncontribute to a more equitable distribution of aid that, \\nunfortunately, quite often remains outside the regular \\neconomic and financial flows. Croatia also welcomes \\ninitiatives to enhance the quality of aid and to increase \\nits impact, bearing in mind the fact that progress both \\nfor donors and for partner countries can be facilitated \\nby the harmonization efforts at the international and \\nregional levels. Therefore, we stress the need for an \\nintegrated approach among international institutions. \\n  \\n \\n06-52885 38 \\n \\n Croatia recognizes the needs of Africa, especially \\nsub-Saharan Africa and the least developed and \\nlandlocked developing States, as well as the special \\nvulnerabilities of small island developing States. We \\nare therefore pleased that those groups of countries \\nreceived specific reference in the Outcome Document \\nof 2005, thus emphasizing their particular needs and \\ncircumstances. The less fortunate must not be left \\nbehind. Special attention should be given to countries \\nemerging from wars and undergoing a costly, complex \\nand highly demanding post-conflict management \\nprocess. \\n Croatia strongly supports yesterday’s official \\nlaunching of the International Drug Purchase Facility \\ninitiative. We see it as a significant step forward and \\nexpress our hopes that all countries will render their \\ncontribution. \\n As a contributor to various United Nations \\nprogrammes and funds, my country confirms its \\ncapacity to support the activities of the United Nations \\nin numerous fields. We will increasingly continue to do \\nso. During the past few years, Croatia has started to \\ncontribute voluntarily to a number of United Nations \\nactivities, programmes and bodies: the United Nations \\nChildren’s Fund, the United Nations Trust Fund for \\nAfrican Development and the Office of the High \\nCommissioner for Human Rights, to mention but a few. \\nBeing a small country, Croatia has limited financial \\nand human resources, but that will not hinder us from \\nsharing, helping and assisting. \\n Global economic and human development must \\nremain in our focus, but as we meet today, the focus is \\nvery much on global tensions and instability. Today, \\nmany ongoing regional crises continue to cause great \\nhumanitarian tragedies around the world, seriously \\ndestabilizing regional and global security. Those arcs \\nof instability are creating a network of fear and anger \\nacross many parts of the world. Terrorism is taking on \\nnew dimensions and forms. Weapons of mass \\ndestruction are yet another cause of grave concern. \\nEconomic imbalances and social impediments are \\nbecoming new sources of instability across the world. \\nReligious divisions and misunderstandings add a new \\nand dangerous dimension to insecurity in the world. \\n The significant growth of international terrorism \\nhas caused an unhealthy atmosphere of mistrust, \\nreligious and cultural intolerance, and grave \\ninfringements of human rights. Those consequences \\nhave in time developed into their own separate and \\nextremely dangerous problems that exponentially \\nthreaten already fragile international relations. \\n The Republic of Croatia, as a member of the \\nglobal anti-terrorist coalition, strongly condemns \\ninternational terrorism in all its forms and \\nmanifestations and, bearing in mind the ever-evolving \\nthreat of terrorism — especially weapons of mass \\ndestruction and cyber-terrorism — calls for even \\nstronger global cooperation in the suppression of that \\nmodern-day scourge. \\n We must prove to our nations that we will stay \\nfirm and united against terrorism. In that light, a strong \\ncommitment to achieving a global consensus on a \\ndefinition of terrorism and a final adoption of the \\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism \\nare very much needed and would reaffirm the central \\nrole of the United Nations in the suppression of \\nterrorism. It that respect, we welcome the United \\nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, launched \\nyesterday, and express our hope that all countries will \\nimplement it. \\n The Republic of Croatia has established very \\ngood cooperation with the United Nations, especially \\nthe Security Council’s Counter-Terrorism Committee \\nand its Executive Directorate. Additionally, on 15 and \\n16 May, a Monitoring Team for the implementation of \\nSecurity Council resolution 1267 (1999) visited \\nCroatia and met with representatives of all relevant \\nGovernment bodies involved in the suppression of \\nterrorism. \\n Year by year, we continue our great cooperation \\nwith the Terrorism Prevention Branch of the United \\nNations Office on Drugs and Crime in Vienna, which \\nhas resulted in a recently held national expert \\nworkshop on international cooperation in criminal \\nmatters related to terrorism, organized through our \\njoint cooperation in June this year in Valbandon, \\nCroatia. \\n Weapons of mass destruction and a common \\napproach to non-proliferation must remain our focus. \\nResponsibility for world peace and security must \\ncontinue to be the key guideline in dealing with that \\ngrave challenge. The rules and standards must be \\nglobally accepted and the United Nations and its \\nspecialized institutions and agencies must continue to \\nplay a pivotal role. \\n \\n \\n39 06-52885 \\n \\n My country won its liberty only a decade ago. \\nAggression and crises in our part of Europe presented \\nthe entire international community with a new \\nchallenge at that time. Regional conflicts emerged as \\nthe new and disturbing roots of new dangers to \\ninternational peace, and they remain a challenge in \\nmany parts of the world. In that light, stability and \\npeace in South-East Europe and post-conflict \\nmanagement and cooperation must be viewed as a \\nsuccess for the international community and the \\ncountries involved. \\n My country played and continues to play a \\nprominent and leading role in providing for long-term \\nstability, cooperation and democratic development for \\nall of South-East Europe, based on the commonly \\nshared vision of a new, united and secure Europe. \\nAlready negotiating future full membership in the \\nEuropean Union, and based on the progress of reforms \\nin the military and the security sector — as well as \\nstanding at the threshold of NATO membership — \\nCroatia is today an anchor of stability, security and \\ncooperation. Croatia is therefore an indispensable \\npartner in the historical transformation of that often-\\ntroubled and critically important region for European \\nand world peace, transforming it into a zone of modern \\nsociety and democratic standards and values. \\n Croatia’s specific position as a Central European, \\nDanubian and Mediterranean country provides added \\nvalue in bilateral and multilateral contacts and \\nexperience, stemming from its participation in \\nnumerous global, European and regional organizations \\nand initiatives in the fields of security, democratic \\ndevelopment and economic cooperation, including \\nCroatia’s current presidency of the South-East \\nEuropean Cooperation Process. \\n Stability, democratic development and \\ncooperation, as well as the resolution of remaining \\nopen issues and completing the security architecture of \\nthat part of Europe, will also have to be closely linked \\nto the indispensability of the protection and promotion \\nof universal values, the rule of law, human rights and \\ndemocracy, as well as their interrelationship with \\nsecurity and development. \\n Croatia supports efforts to accelerate democracy’s \\nmovement around the world, particularly through such \\nintergovernmental organizations as the Community of \\nDemocracies. Last year, as a signatory of the Warsaw \\nDeclaration of the Community of Democracies, the \\nRepublic of Croatia contributed to the founding of the \\nUnited Nations Democracy Fund to reaffirm its \\ncommitment to encouraging other countries on their \\npath to democratization. \\n Croatia welcomes the fact that the International \\nCriminal Court (ICC) has begun work on its first cases. \\nWe attach great importance to the continuation of the \\nICC’s successful work. Croatia also welcomes the fact \\nthat the number of States parties to the Rome Statute \\nhas reached and surpassed 100, and we hope that the \\nnumber will continue to rise. The Republic of Croatia \\nalso supports the work of the International Criminal \\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in pursuing \\nits completion strategy. Croatia continues to fully \\ncooperate with the ICTY as part of our own \\nadvancement towards the rule of law, and also as an \\nindicator and impetus for the region, with the aim of \\novercoming the legacy of the recent past in South-East \\nEurope. \\n The Republic of Croatia has been a member of \\nnumerous United Nations bodies and very active in \\norganizing and hosting conferences and other \\nmultilateral activities. My country is now ready to take \\nthe next step in strengthening our responsibility as a \\nMember of the United Nations. For that reason, the \\nRepublic of Croatia has presented its candidature for a \\nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council for the \\nterm 2008-2009 at the elections to be held in 2007. \\n Croatia recognizes the importance of global \\nmultilateralism, as well as the growing significance of \\nregional organizations in tackling the challenges of \\ntoday’s world. The role of the United Nations in the \\npromotion of international cooperation for \\ndevelopment and the achievement of the development \\ngoals agreed by the international community must \\nremain fundamental, pivotal and re-energized. We also \\nwelcome the strengthening of coordination within the \\nUnited Nations system, in close cooperation with all \\nother multilateral financial, trade and development \\ninstitutions, in order to support sustained economic \\ngrowth and sustainable development. \\n Allow me to refer to one of the messages of the \\nOutcome Document of last year’s Summit — namely, \\nthe notion that there will be no development without \\nsecurity and no security without development. We \\nacknowledge that peace and security, development and \\nhuman rights are the pillars of the United Nations \\nsystem and the basis of our collective security and \\n  \\n \\n06-52885 40 \\n \\nwell-being. We recognize that development, peace, \\nsecurity and human rights are interdependent and \\nmutually reinforcing. In facing that challenge, the \\nUnited Nations system is called on to play an enhanced \\ndevelopment role. \\n Croatia welcomes the inauguration of the Human \\nRights Council and considers it to be a milestone for \\nthe global promotion of human rights. My country also \\nwelcomes the establishment of the Peacebuilding \\nCommission, which arose from the need for a \\ncoordinated and integrated approach to post-conflict \\npeacebuilding. \\n My country is pleased to have been elected to the \\nPeacebuilding Commission in May, and I would like to \\nuse this opportunity to thank all the States that voted \\nfor us and placed their confidence in Croatia. Our wish \\nis to contribute actively to the United Nations system \\nof collective security in an effective and transparent \\nway, as embodied in the Charter and aligned with the \\nMillennium Declaration. \\n Croatia welcomes another visible result of the \\nefforts to reform the United Nations — the \\nestablishment of the Human Rights Council as the \\nmain standing body of the United Nations on human \\nrights. \\n Now, allow me to share some remarks on one of \\nthe most important tasks we need to address. \\n In this fragile world, the need for an efficient and \\ndemocratic world body is ever increasing. The Summit \\nof heads of State and Government held in 2005 \\nprovided us with a platform for further action toward \\nthe reform of our Organization. There has been noted \\nprogress on several important reform issues, but we \\ncannot be satisfied with the pace of the process. My \\ncountry believes that the reform of the Organization \\nand of the Security Council must justly take account of \\nthe interests of all. Croatia advocates the enlargement \\nof the Security Council in both the permanent and non-\\npermanent categories of membership, based on \\nappropriate regional representation in which the \\nEastern European Group would have two non-\\npermanent seats. It is of the utmost importance in a \\nnew, enlarged Council to have an appropriate number \\nof representatives of the developing countries of the \\nSouth and better representation of small and medium-\\nsized countries. \\n Additionally, the reform of the Council should \\nextend to its working methods and its interaction with \\nother principal bodies of the Organization, first and \\nmost importantly the Economic and Social Council. \\nThat would strengthen the United Nations in a wide \\nrange of areas, including peace and security, \\ndevelopment and human rights. There is also a need to \\nimprove United Nations management practices and \\nworking methods to raise the whole system to a higher \\nlevel of transparency and accountability.  \\n Mindful that peace and security are prerequisites \\nfor economic and social prosperity, Croatia would like \\nto remain engaged in and responsive to current \\nconcerns on reforming the United Nations system in \\norder to make it a stronger and more effective \\nOrganization for times to come. That is our common \\nresponsibility. We need to act today in order to prepare \\nourselves in a timely manner for the challenges of \\ntomorrow. \\n Although one third of the entire Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals period is already behind us, the \\ntargets set are, regrettably, not being met at the desired \\npace. That must be changed as a matter of urgency, as \\nit is undoubtedly an issue affecting the future security \\nand stability of the world. We must move forward in \\nassisting developing countries and other countries in \\nneed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. \\n As I mentioned at the outset of my address, \\nCroatia has presented its candidature for a non-\\npermanent seat on the Security Council for the term \\n2008-2009, the elections for which are to be held in \\n2007. I feel the need to stress that Croatia’s candidacy \\nis, above all, a measure of Croatia’s responsibility. \\n I have mentioned the fragility of today’s world. I \\nhave not mentioned the fragility, uncertainties and \\nchallenges that Croatia experienced in the recent past. \\nThey are well known, but at the same time they are the \\nsource of our understanding of and responsiveness to \\nthe needs of a fragile world. We believe that we can \\ncontribute to building a new cooperative world in \\nresponding to our new challenges and to enhancing our \\nOrganization. Croatian membership in the Security \\nCouncil would also serve as a telling demonstration of \\nthe success of the peace process in South-East Europe. \\n My country went through a successful transition \\nfrom being a country receiving peacekeeping forces to \\none that is now a contributor to 11 of the 18 United \\nNations peacekeeping operations in various regions \\n \\n \\n41 06-52885 \\n \\nthroughout the world. Croatia also provides training \\nand hosts international courses in the field of \\npeacebuilding. We are therefore well aware of the \\nadded value that countries that have rebuilt their \\nnational capacities bring to the credibility of such an \\nimportant body for the cause of international peace, \\nsecurity and development. Croatia stands determined to \\ncontinue to support peace efforts and a strengthened \\nUnited Nations role on a regional and global level. ',\n",
       " 'These days, the days of the \\ngeneral debate of the General Assembly, fall this year \\nat a time of unique significance for the Jewish people. \\nThey come on the eve of the Jewish New Year and the \\nDay of Atonement and are known as the Days of Awe. \\n In Jewish tradition, these are days of soul-\\nsearching and prayer, of judgement and of renewal. \\nThat concept of reflection is fitting not just for the \\nfaithful. It should be a time of reflection for nations as \\nwell. Let us use this time and this gathering to look \\ndeeply and honestly at the world in which we live — \\nthe world as it is and as it might be. The United \\nNations emerged from the horrors of war and offered a \\nvision of a new and peaceful world, but we see the \\nsuffering of the people of Darfur, we see bloodshed and \\nviolence across the globe, and we know that that is not \\nyet the world in which we live. \\n Our planet remains torn by conflict, At its heart, \\nthis is a conflict about values — a battle of ideas. It is a \\nconflict about whether to respect or to reject the \\nother — a conflict between tolerance and tyranny, \\nbetween the promise of coexistence and the \\nhopelessness of hate. We see it played out in internet \\nchat rooms and in houses of prayer, in classrooms and \\nnewsrooms, on the battlefield and in the corridors of \\npower. It is the challenge of our time. \\n We, the people of Israel, have lived for many \\nyears on the frontlines of this conflict. Our nation has \\nfelt its fury; our soldiers have fought and died in its \\nbattles. An ancient people in the heart of the Middle \\nEast — great in history but small in number — we \\nhave been a constant target of those that oppose our \\nvery existence. We face this conflict on different \\nfronts — as Jews against the dark forces of anti-\\nSemitism, as Israelis against the enemies of our \\nstatehood, and as members of the free world against \\nthe merchants of global terror. \\n We have been guided in this conflict by two core \\nvalues that are embodied in our declaration of \\nindependence and shape our national identity. The first \\nis that Israel, with Jerusalem at its heart, is the national \\nhomeland of the Jewish people, their refuge from \\npersecution, their first and last line of defence. The \\nsecond is that Israel is a democracy and that the values \\nof justice, peace and humanity — first expressed by the \\nprophets of Israel — are an integral part of our nation’s \\nsense of mission. We share the same values as the \\ncommunity of democratic States. We are ready and \\nproud to be judged by them. They are our own.  \\n  \\n \\n06-52885 44 \\n \\n But too often there is a gap between perception \\nand reality. Too often, Israel is not seen for its unique \\ncreativity and spirit of enterprise, or for its \\ncontribution — well beyond its size — to the sciences \\nand to literature, to human development and \\ninnovation. In many parts of the world, we are seen \\nmainly through the lens of the Arab-Israeli conflict. \\nAnd too often, that lens is distorted. To many, this \\nconflict is portrayed as a clash of David and Goliath, \\nwith Israel perceived unjustly as Goliath, but this \\nsimplistic image ignores the fact that Israel remains a \\nthreatened democracy in a hostile region. \\n We have, of necessity, the capacity to defend \\nourselves, but we will always be constrained in its use \\nby our values. And yet, we face an enemy willing to \\nuse all the means at its disposal to kill without restraint \\nand without distinction. Every innocent casualty in this \\nconflict is a tragedy. There is no difference between the \\ntears of a grieving Israeli mother and a grieving \\nPalestinian mother, but there is a critical moral \\ndifference between the terrorists who hunt down \\ncivilians and the soldiers who target terrorists while \\ntrying to avoid civilian casualties. \\n To protect its integrity, the international \\ncommunity must uphold that basic moral distinction. \\nTerror is terror, even when it is called resistance. It \\ncannot be justified and it cannot be equated with the \\nactions of those seeking only to defend themselves \\nagainst it. \\n If we want to protect our values, it is not enough \\nto believe in them — we must act according to them. \\nThere is no greater challenge to our values than that \\nposed by the leaders of Iran. They deny and mock the \\nHolocaust. They speak proudly and openly of their \\ndesire to wipe Israel off the map. And now, by their \\nactions, they pursue the weapons to achieve that \\nobjective, to imperil the region and to threaten the \\nworld. The moment of truth is here. \\n The international community is faced with no \\ngreater responsibility than to stand against that dark \\nand growing danger — not for Israel’s sake, but for its \\nown; for the sake of the values it claims to embrace; \\nfor the sake of the world we all wish our children to \\ninherit. What more needs to happen for the world to \\ntake the threat seriously? What more needs to happen \\nto end the hesitation and the excuses? We know the \\nlessons of the past. We know the consequences of \\nappeasement and indifference. There is no place for \\nsuch leaders in this forum. There is no place for such a \\nregime in the family of nations. \\n For any who still had doubts, the Iranian threat \\nwas exposed to all in the recent conflict in Lebanon. \\nArmed, financed and directed by Iran, Hizbullah \\nkidnapped Israeli soldiers and targeted Israeli cities, \\nbut it was the hopes of an entire region that they sought \\nto take hostage. Out of the conflict — and because of \\nIsrael’s response to it — opportunity has emerged, but \\nmuch is needed to turn opportunity into reality. \\nHizbullah can never again be allowed to threaten the \\nfuture of the region. The world faces a critical test — \\nto ensure the full implementation of resolution 1701 \\n(2006) and the immediate and safe release of the Israeli \\nhostages. \\n As we gather here, we think of anxious families \\nthat ache for the return of their loved ones — parents \\nwaiting for a son, a brother for a brother, a wife for a \\nhusband. Israel will not rest until all the Israeli \\nhostages are returned safely to the arms of their \\ndevoted families and to the embrace of a loving nation. \\nLet us all make them the same promise today. \\n Last year, a great leader of Israel, Ariel Sharon, \\nstood before this forum and said:  \\n “The Palestinians will always be our neighbours. \\nWe respect them and have no aspirations to rule \\nover them. They are also entitled to freedom and \\nto a national, sovereign existence in a State of \\ntheir own.” (A/60/PV.5, p.46) \\n That was not only the voice and vision of one \\nman. It is the voice and vision of a nation. We do not \\nbelieve that Israeli-Palestinian relations are of \\nnecessity a zero-sum game. Not every Israeli interest is \\nat odds with Palestinian interests. There is, in fact, a \\ncommon vision that binds together Israelis, moderate \\nPalestinians and the international community. It serves \\nthe goals of both peoples and represents the basis of a \\ngenuine and lasting peace. At its heart is the vision of \\ntwo States, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in \\npeace and security. Israel believes in this vision, and \\nfrom this vision we have drawn our principles for \\npeace. \\n The first is inherent in the very idea of two \\nStates. For the Jewish people, Israel was established to \\nbe our national homeland. It was the solution for \\nJewish refugees and the realization of Jewish rights. \\nAnd this is the true calling of the future State of \\n \\n \\n45 06-52885 \\n \\nPalestine: a national homeland for the Palestinian \\npeople — the solution to Palestinian claims, the \\nfulfilment of Palestinian dreams, the answer for \\nPalestinian refugees, wherever they may be. If \\nPalestinian leaders are unwilling to say this, the world \\nshould say it for them. Instead of giving false hope, it \\nis time to end the exploitation of the refugee issue and \\nto begin to resolve it on the basis of the vision of two \\nStates, two homelands.  \\n That is the real and only meaning of the two-State \\nvision. It requires each people to accept that their \\nrights are realized through the establishment of their \\nown homeland, not in the homeland of others.  \\n The second principle for peace is drawn from the \\nconcept of living in peace and security. On the basis of \\nthis principle the international community has insisted \\nthat the State of Palestine that emerges next to Israel \\ncannot be a terror State. A terrorist State is the last \\nthing our troubled region needs. It is for that reason \\nthat the road map requires an end to terror. It is for that \\nreason that the international community has demanded \\nthat any Palestinian Government fulfil three basic \\nconditions: renounce terrorism, recognize Israel’s right \\nto exist and accept existing Israeli-Palestinian \\nagreements. Those conditions are not an obstacle to \\npeace or to the establishment of a responsible \\nPalestinian State; they are a crucial ingredient for the \\nrealization of those goals.  \\n An end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will also \\nrequire agreement on a common boundary. There are \\nthose who believe that if only we could turn back the \\nhands of time to 1967 all would be resolved. But, in \\n1967 there was no Palestinian State; there was no link \\nbetween the West Bank and Gaza; and there was no \\ncommitment to lasting peace. A two-State solution \\nrequires the creation of a new reality which never \\nexisted in the past. For it to succeed, both sides will \\nneed to commit themselves to compromise and to \\nbelieve in coexistence. \\n If only we could end the conflict today. But we \\nhave learned from bitter experience that to reach \\nlasting peace it is not enough to have a vision. Peace \\nmust be built on the solid foundations of shared values, \\nnot the shifting sands of false promises. Without this, \\nthe political horizon will always be out of reach. We \\nhave seen negotiations doomed by mistrust and \\nfrustration. We have seen them lay the ground for \\ngreater violence, not greater understanding. We cannot \\nafford to repeat that experience. \\n Unfortunately, the Palestinian Authority is \\ndominated today by a terrorist organization that teaches \\nchildren to hate and seeks to transform the conflict \\nfrom a resolvable political dispute into an endless \\nreligious confrontation. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict \\nis the consequence and not the cause of this ideology \\nof intolerance and hatred. We cannot reach peace by \\nignoring these realities. We cannot find the solutions \\nfor tomorrow without addressing the problems of \\ntoday. \\n But we also cannot give up hope, and I refuse to \\ndo so. In a Middle East where being moderate is often \\nthe same as being weak, our challenge is to empower \\nthe peacemakers and disempower their opponents. The \\nroad map phases and the three international conditions \\nare designed precisely for that purpose. But if the \\nworld hesitates in enforcing these standards, the \\nextremists sense opportunity. And if it appeases, they \\nsense victory. This is the moment for determination not \\nhalf-measures and vague formulations. It is the \\nmoment to demand that those Palestinian leaders that \\nbelieve in peace determine the future on these terms, \\nnot on the terms of terrorists. \\n Unfortunately, there are no shortcuts on the road \\nto peace. But stagnation is not in our interest, and it is \\nnot our policy. \\n It is in this spirit that Israel embarked on the \\npainful process of disengagement, to create an \\nopportunity for progress. But, sadly, we received terror \\nin return. And it is in this spirit that I met with \\nChairman Abbas two days ago, and we agreed to re-\\nenergize the dialogue between us and create a \\npermanent channel to pursue ways to advance together. \\nThe parties do not need another forum to act out their \\ndifferences, and the only forum that will resolve them \\nis the bilateral negotiating table. We have no illusions \\nabout the difficulties before us. We must face them not \\nignore them. But we can advance along the road to \\npeace if we have the strength to defend its principles \\nand the courage to confront its enemies. \\n In these days, while Jews prepare to welcome a \\nnew year, Muslims around the world prepare for the \\nholy month of Ramadan. As two great faiths begin their \\nannual journey of reflection and decision, let the \\nnations of the world begin it too. \\n  \\n \\n06-52885 46 \\n \\n The Jewish prayers tell us that this is a time of \\ndecision not just for individuals but also for States: \\n“which for the sword and which for peace, which for \\nfamine and which for plenty”. \\n Those are sobering words, but they are also \\nempowering ones. The message of these special days is \\nthat no future is predetermined; no conflict is \\ninevitable. It is up to us to make the right choices. \\nHistory will judge us by them. In the words of the \\ntraditional greeting: may the curses of the last year \\nend; may the blessing of the new year begin. Shana \\ntova: may it be a good year. ',\n",
       " 'I shall speak today on four \\nfundamental topics: climate change, cybersecurity, \\nconflict resolution and cooperation among international \\norganizations. \\n In accordance with the United Nations \\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, as well as \\nthe Kyoto Protocol, industrialized countries are \\nobligated to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases. \\nEstonia has already achieved the basic target of the \\nKyoto Protocol: our emissions of greenhouse gases \\nhave been cut back by over 50 per cent. Fully \\nsubscribing to the European Union statement on the \\npost-2012 vision for international climate, released by \\nthe Portuguese presidency, we hope that the \\nnegotiations concerning a new global climate deal will \\nreach a new comprehensive and global political \\nagreement by as early as December 2009.  \\n Yes, we recognize that developing countries have \\nspecial needs in the areas of sustainable economic \\ngrowth and eradication of poverty. But we also need to \\ndecouple economic growth from energy consumption \\nand carbon dioxide emissions. Investing in energy \\nefficiency will have a huge impact on our future. \\nDiversification of the energy supply and greater use of \\nrenewable energies are the way forward.  \\n The resources and the technology for \\ndecarbonisation come primarily from industrial \\nnations. Therefore, we need to continue the dialogue \\nbetween industrialized and developing nations \\nconcerning the adoption of a “green” economy, \\nreducing carbon-fuel dependency and counterbalancing \\nclimate change caused by human activities. We need to \\npromote technology transfer, which is necessary for \\ndeveloping environment-friendly energy production. \\nEstonia believes that the best way forward is to tie \\ndevelopment assistance to investment in clean \\ntechnologies. \\n If in the past people were connected by sea lanes \\nand trade routes, today we are ever more connected by \\nthe Internet, along with the threats that loom in \\ncyberspace. Cyberattacks are a clear example of \\ncontemporary asymmetrical threats to security. They \\nmake it possible, with limited means and from a \\ndistance, to paralyse a society.  \\n In the future, cyberattacks may, in the hands of \\ncriminals or terrorists or terrorist States, become a \\nconsiderably more widespread and dangerous weapon \\nthan they are at present. Cyberattacks are a threat not \\nonly to sophisticated information technology systems, \\nbut also to communities as a whole. For example, they \\ncould be used to paralyse a city’s emergency medical \\nservices. The threats posed by cyberwarfare have often \\nbeen underestimated, since, fortunately, they have not \\nas yet resulted in the loss of any lives. Also, for \\nsecurity reasons, the details of cyberattacks are often \\nnot publicized.  \\n In addition to taking concrete technical and legal \\nmeasures to counter cyberattacks, Governments must \\nmorally define cyberviolence and cybercrime, which \\ndeserve to be generally condemned in the same way as \\nterrorism and the trafficking in human beings are \\ncondemned. Fighting against cyberwarfare is in the \\ninterests of us all. It requires both appropriate domestic \\nmeasures and international efforts. \\n In April and May of this year, my country, \\nEstonia, coped successfully with an extensive \\ncyberattack, and we are prepared to share with other \\ncountries the know-how that we have acquired. We call \\nupon the international community to cooperate in legal \\nmatters in questions concerning cybersecurity. But, \\nsince this whole subject is in a relatively new field, it is \\nessential to establish an appropriate legal space. As a \\nfirst step, we call upon all countries to accede to the \\nConvention on Cybercrime of the Council of Europe. \\nThe Convention is also open for accession by  \\nnon-members of the Council. \\n We should move ahead and create a truly \\ninternational framework for combating these vicious \\nacts. The Global Cybersecurity Agenda of the \\nInternational Telecommunications Union, launched by \\nthe Secretary-General in May, is an important initiative \\nfor building international cooperation in this field. \\nEstonia also agrees with the assessment of the \\nspecialists of the United Nations Institute for Training \\nand Research that a globally negotiated and \\ncomprehensive cyberspace law is essential and that the \\nUnited Nations can provide the neutral and legitimate \\nforum necessary for that task. \\n The United Nations is determined to resolve \\nconflicts. Understandably, conflict prevention and \\nresolution, particularly in Africa, is a top priority. We \\nwelcome the creation of a United Nations-African \\nUnion peacekeeping force to quell the violence and \\ninstability plaguing the Darfur region of the Sudan. \\n It is important to settle conflicts in other places as \\nwell, such as Afghanistan. We need to increase the \\npresence and visibility of the United Nations there, \\nwhich would be an encouraging sign for the local \\npopulation and would also send a signal to other \\ninternational aid organizations and non-governmental \\norganizations that they should increase their activities. \\nThe United Nations should also assume a greater role \\nin coordinating the reconstruction effort in \\nAfghanistan. \\n I would like to highlight one conflict in Europe in \\nwhich the United Nations has a significant role to play: \\nthe conflict in Abkhazia, Georgia. Along with the other \\n“frozen” conflicts in the neighbouring region, it \\nremains among the last unresolved conflicts in Europe. \\nIt is my hope that the Group of Friends of the \\nSecretary-General will have the determination to find \\nsolutions that honour Georgia’s territorial integrity. We \\ncannot be satisfied with the current situation. It is \\nimportant to build confidence between the parties and \\nto resume the meetings between the representatives of \\nGeorgia’s Government and those of Abkhazia. There is \\nno place for military provocations, internal or external.  \\n A major task for the United Nations remains the \\nfacilitation of the return of refugees to Abkhazia, \\nwhich, unfortunately, has been greatly hampered. \\nProgress regarding the conflict is possible if all \\ninterested parties act in a constructive way. We must \\ngenerate the political will necessary to resolve the \\nconflict. In that context, I welcome the increased \\ncontribution of the European Union (EU). \\n The international community should also secure \\nthe best and most rational use of available resources, \\nincluding in emergency and crisis response situations. \\nFor example, both the United Nations and the EU were \\ninvolved in managing the response to the Asian \\ntsunami in 2004 and the Lebanese crisis in 2006. That \\nonce again brought to the fore the necessity of \\ndeveloping common needs assessments   to further \\ndiscuss the roles and mandates of the relevant actors, \\nsuch as the United Nations Office for the Coordination \\nof Humanitarian Affairs, the European Commission’s \\nDirectorate-General for Humanitarian Aid and the \\nCommunity Mechanism for Civil Protection of the EU. \\n Poverty, armed conflicts and natural disasters \\nsuch as floods, tsunamis and forest fires are all causes \\nof another global problem   forced migration, which \\nshould also be tackled in a more concerted manner by \\nthe whole international community. Being forced to \\nleave one’s home is always a tragedy. I know: my \\nfamily was forced to leave my country, fleeing brutal \\nSoviet occupation forces. Trying to integrate into a new \\nsociety is always a significant challenge. Only through \\nwell-coordinated common efforts can we ensure that \\npeople never again have to leave their homes because \\nthey have no other option. Thus, a global approach to \\nhuman migration should remain a vital issue on the \\nUnited Nations agenda. \\n',\n",
       " 'It is always inspiring to \\ncome to this forum and, time and again, observe that \\nthere are many more things that unite rather than divide \\nnations around the globe. Indeed, we are united in our \\nvision of a world free of violence, where every \\nindividual has freedom of choice and where human \\ndignity is respected. We are united in our aspirations to \\nmeet the challenges of the twenty-first century, because \\nwe know that in a globalized world a threat to one \\nnation is a threat to all nations. \\n Nowhere is this new reality more evident than in \\nthe much-needed work of the United Nations. Poverty, \\nimbalances in development, armaments, the spread of \\nideologies of hatred, cybercrime: those are some of the \\nthreats that we face today. The new, daunting \\nchallenges are different in kind. Therefore, both \\nindividual States and the international community have \\nto find ways to deal with this new reality and how to \\nrespond better to new challenges. \\n Seven years ago, at this United Nations conclave, \\nall nations made a historic step, pledging to eradicate \\npoverty, illiteracy and environmental degradation, and \\nto improve health and promote gender equality. That \\nwas our response to the challenges of the time. This \\nyear, we are halfway to the 2015 deadline for achieving \\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Over the \\npast few years, an estimated 135 million people \\nmanaged to get out of extreme poverty. Significant \\npositive changes are taking place in the fields of \\nprimary education for poor children, child vaccination \\nand better access to retroviral treatment for persons \\nwith HIV/AIDS, to name but a few. \\n Yet overall progress in achieving the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals remains uneven and too slow. If \\nwe want to live up to our commitments, we must \\nincrease our efforts considerably and urgently. \\n The twenty-first century has also confronted us \\nwith such challenges as a deteriorating environment. \\nGlobal warming affects all aspects of our lives from \\nsocial and economic growth to changing habitats and \\nmigration patterns. Time is clearly not on our side. We \\nare taking measures to adapt our policies to counter \\nclimate change, but our actions are obviously too slow \\nand sometimes too reluctant. Therefore, Lithuania \\nwelcomes the Secretary-General’s focus on climate \\nchange as a global challenge that requires global \\nconcerted efforts. We believe that the United Nations \\nclimate change process is the appropriate forum for \\nnegotiating future global action in this effort. \\n But that already may not be enough. I am \\nconvinced that the world needs a more coherent and \\ninclusive system of international environmental \\ngovernance. This system needs to be strengthened by \\nestablishing a United Nations Environment \\nOrganization, based on the United Nations \\nEnvironment Programme (UNEP) with a revised \\nmandate. With December’s Bali climate change \\nconference in mind, I call on all countries to come to \\nthe negotiating table later this year with the ambition \\nof concluding by 2009 a global and comprehensive \\npost-2012 agreement. Before such an agreement is \\nreached, Lithuania is doing its best to fulfil the \\ncommitment of the European Union to achieve at least \\na 20 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by \\n2020 compared to 1990 levels. \\n We have started to focus on a wider use of \\nindigenous and renewable energy resources. The share \\nof these resources in the primary energy balance in \\nLithuania will increase up to 12 per cent by the year \\n2010. Last year alone, we planted 21,000 hectares of \\ntrees, an area that corresponds to 32,000 soccer fields. \\nFor a country the size of Lithuania, that is no small \\nmeasure. These are but a few of the concrete steps by \\nwhich my country shows political will sufficient to \\nfight new global challenges. \\n The necessity to fit in and effectively integrate \\ninto the international system has been the cornerstone \\nof our policies since we regained our independence in \\n1990. Membership in the European Union and NATO \\nis the best example of success in that effort. Now we \\nare taking on increasing responsibility in the fields of \\nsecurity, stability and sustainability in our region and \\nbeyond. We are active at the front of the war against \\nterrorism, including our contribution to restoring \\nstability and security in Iraq. We are leading a \\nProvincial Reconstruction Team in Afghanistan’s Ghor \\nprovince. Over the past two years, Lithuania has \\ndoubled its development aid budget and has committed \\nto increasing it to 0.33 per cent of its gross national \\nincome by 2015. Our contribution to global security \\nand the vision of inclusiveness and of building a \\n“Europe whole and free” motivated Lithuania to offer \\nits candidacy for the chairmanship of the Organization \\nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe in 2010. \\n If Lithuania and the Baltic region in general are a \\nsuccess story in terms of establishing themselves in a \\nnew global environment, some countries in our region \\nare not. We may only guess why those countries \\nperceive the integration of democracies on their \\nborders as a national threat. We feel sorry for a society \\nat large when its Government chooses to spend the \\ncountry’s natural riches on guns and not on democratic \\nreforms. Clearly, we should not tolerate attempts to \\nfalsify historical facts about the Soviet occupation of \\nthe Baltic States or the denial of the deliberately \\ncaused Holodomor in Ukraine, which killed millions. \\n Fitting in is never easy. Therefore, we consider \\nthat the United Nations could help Member States to \\nefficiently integrate into the international system, as \\nthe European Union is already doing by engaging its \\nneighbours in this process through various \\nneighbourhood instruments and cooperation formats. \\n However, our readiness to stand up and speak \\nopenly to States if they cross the line is also an \\nindispensable element of that effort. We should ask \\nourselves: where did we fail, that the killings of \\nhundreds of thousands of innocent people were \\npermitted to take place in Darfur?  \\n Today conflicts occur on every continent, with \\nparticularly grave consequences in Africa and the \\nMiddle East. Some conflicts in the world, however, are \\nless visible. But that does not make them less \\ndangerous. Frozen conflicts in Eastern Europe and the \\nSouth Caucasus may become very hot one day unless \\nwe act immediately. We consider it morally \\nunacceptable for the international community to remain \\nindifferent to the frozen conflicts in the GUAM area. \\nLet us not forget that it is not only the conflicts that are \\nfrozen; the lives and dreams of the people living in \\nthose areas of artificial conflict are also frozen. That is \\nwhere the United Nations should be more visible and \\nmore outspoken. That also applies to Kosovo, where \\nattempts to create another frozen conflict must be \\nexcluded. \\n It is not only States, but also the United Nations \\nitself that must adapt to new, changing realities. We \\nencourage the Secretary-General to continue the reform \\nof the United Nations, in particular making the \\nOrganization’s operational system more consolidated, \\ncoherent and effective, with the highest standards of \\nconduct and ethics. We must proceed with real actions \\nin carrying through the reform of the United Nations. \\nThe Secretary-General has my full support in this \\ncontext. He should be applauded for his bold and \\nforward-thinking vision of the reform in United \\nNations peacekeeping. We welcome all efforts by the \\nUnited Nations to streamline and reform the \\npeacekeeping procurement system. \\n I encourage the United Nations to further \\nstrengthen, develop and use its capabilities in the area \\nof good offices and conflict prevention, as envisioned \\nin the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1). \\nThat would enable us to address many issues in a more \\nefficient manner and, hopefully, to avoid costly \\npeacekeeping operations. \\n The prevention of nuclear proliferation and the \\npursuit of nuclear disarmament in accordance with the \\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \\nare crucial for global peace and security. We need to \\nstrengthen the authority of the Treaty. Lithuania will \\nsupport the process leading to the elaboration of a \\nbinding international arms trade treaty. Lithuania will \\nalso continue to increase practical assistance and \\nfunding to international mine action projects and the \\nimplementation of the Programme of Action on Small \\nArms and Light Weapons. \\n Two years have passed since the adoption of the \\nWorld Summit Outcome, which elaborated on the \\nconcept of the responsibility to protect, and yet we \\nhave been too slow in responding to massive violations \\nof human rights and mass atrocities. The principle of \\nthe responsibility to protect can no longer be confined \\nto paper. We therefore encourage the Secretary-General \\nto follow up on the World Summit document and take \\nmeasures to operationalize that principle. \\n Only a reformed and proactive United Nations \\nwill be truly instrumental and effective. Only such a \\nUnited Nations will have the required support and \\nfinancing. Only such a United Nations will be trusted \\nby the people. \\n The ability to adapt is the quality of the strong. \\nFitting in is the least we can do for future generations. \\nIt is the responsibility of every nation and the \\ninternational community as such.  \\n',\n",
       " 'Allow me to begin by \\ncongratulating Mr. Miguel d’Escoto Brockmann upon \\nhis assumption of the office of President of the General \\nAssembly. I wish him success in his responsibilities \\nand endeavours. I also wish to express my appreciation \\nand respect to his predecessor, Mr. Srgjan Kerim, for \\nhis effective leadership during the sixty-second session \\nof the General Assembly. \\n I shall be brief. I would like to speak today about \\nthe following three issues: the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and the prospects for \\nrealizing them; natural disasters and humanitarian \\nassistance; and the war between Georgia and Russia, \\nalong with some of the conclusions that can be drawn \\nfrom it. \\n Let me begin with the Millennium Development \\nGoals. We must bear in mind that over half of the time \\noriginally allotted for achieving the Goals is already \\nbehind us. Yet, have we actually reached half our \\ngoals? As Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon reported \\nhere 20 days ago, there are reasons to doubt that we \\nhave. Some achievements can be regarded as \\nnoteworthy progress, for example greater access to \\neducation, a marked reduction in infant mortality, debt \\nrelief for developing countries, an increase in access to \\ninformation and communication technology for people \\nin developing countries, and so on. We have also made \\ncertain progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS. \\n At the same time, however, progress in the \\nspheres of trade and development cooperation has been \\nmodest. From the Secretary-General’s report, it is clear \\nthat, although the donor States have increased their \\nofficial development aid, the actual flow of financial \\nassistance in the course of the past two years has \\nactually decreased. \\n The European Union, of which Estonia is a \\nmember, is on the whole, on track towards increasing \\nits development aid to 0.7 per cent of its gross national \\nincome, the objective agreed at the United Nations. \\nEstonia has steadily increased its share among \\ninternational donors; our development aid has grown \\nfourfold since 2004. \\n In addition to the actual decrease in development \\naid, we suffered a serious setback when the Doha \\nDevelopment Round of trade negotiations stalled and \\nwhere the main theme has been a more efficient \\nintegration of developing countries into a world trading \\nsystem based upon equality and regulations. \\n I would now like to set forth several positions \\nbased upon matters of principle that Estonia regards as \\nessential, and which are also part of the United Nations \\nMillennium Declaration. \\n First, every nation is primarily responsible for its \\nown development. In order to ensure their proper \\ndevelopment, developing countries must strengthen \\ntheir administrative infrastructure and capacity, \\nintensify their fight against corruption and put their \\neconomic  environment in order. That is the only way \\nto create conditions suitable for an efficient mode of \\n  \\n \\n08-51839 8 \\n \\ntransferring development aid and for increasing the \\nbenefits of the aid received. \\n High levels of corruption, inefficient \\nadministrative capacity and an unresponsive economic \\nclimate make it difficult for donor-nation public \\nopinion to support increases in development aid. In a \\nword, our electorates — and here I am of course \\nspeaking of democratic countries with free and fair \\nelections — do not understand why their taxes are \\nspent that way. \\n Secondly, donor States and organizations can \\nenhance the effectiveness of development cooperation \\nby mutually coordinating and standardizing the \\nprocedures involved in development cooperation. \\n Finally, I would like to stress that Estonia \\nstrongly supports British Prime Minister Gordon \\nBrown’s and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s \\ninitiative, the Millennium Development Goals Call to \\nAction. The objective is to inform the general public of \\nthe importance of fulfilling the objectives of the \\nMillennium Development Goals programme. This year, \\nEstonia also joined that initiative. I personally hope \\nthat Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was right when he \\nsaid that the MDGs are still achievable if we act now. \\n The second Wednesday of October is the \\nInternational Day for Natural Disaster Reduction. In \\nthat connection, as opposed to the fight against poverty \\nor diseases, we cannot of course set objectives for \\nourselves that can be expressed in monetary amounts. \\nWe can, however, formulate and implement measures \\nthat can help to minimize the dangers and threats to \\npeople and their property, and to avoid or reduce \\ndestruction to physical infrastructure and the \\nenvironment. We can thereby limit losses and alleviate \\nthe suffering of people. That, in turn, can prevent the \\nsocial and economic convulsions that natural \\ncatastrophes have on repeated occasions triggered \\nthroughout history. \\n In the case of humanitarian catastrophes, be they \\nnatural or man-made disasters, it is of the utmost \\nimportance that help arrive on the scene as quickly as \\npossible and that the access of humanitarian experts be \\nensured, regardless of their nationality or the State or \\norganization that they represent. Unfortunately, there \\nhave recently been a number of occasions when \\nvarious countries have permitted help from abroad only \\nunder very specific conditions. As a result of such \\npolicies, it is the weakest and the most vulnerable who \\nsuffer the most. \\n As I said earlier, I would like to talk about recent \\nand ongoing events in the southern Caucasus, \\nspecifically the military conflict between Georgia and \\nRussia. There are a series of complex issues involved, \\nbut here in the General Assembly I would like to raise \\none fundamental question: What do those events mean \\nfor us, the United Nations? \\n To begin with, we must realize that the principles \\ngoverning relations between States have been seriously \\ndamaged. It is regrettable in the extreme that the basic \\nprinciples of the United Nations as enshrined in the \\nCharter, such as the unacceptability of threatening the \\nuse of force or actual aggression against a nation’s \\nterritorial integrity, were grossly and grotesquely \\nviolated. Those principles must be and must remain the \\nbases for the activity of the United Nations and the \\nSecurity Council. Therefore, we have the right to \\ndemand and ensure that the United Nations be capable \\nof convincing one Member to withdraw its military \\nforces from the territory of another sovereign Member \\nState and to terminate its aggression. \\n The capacity of the United Nations to fulfil the \\nexpectations placed upon it cannot be dependent upon \\nwhether said Member nation chooses or not to act \\naccording to the good practices of international law. In \\nthe alternative case, the United Nations loses its reason \\nfor existence. We cannot allow international law to be \\nfollowed selectively and only when convenient, for \\nthen it is no longer law.  \\n Russia’s behaviour in the weeks following the \\ncessation of combat activity showed us that, \\nunfortunately, even in the first decade of the twenty-\\nfirst century, it is possible to refuse to adhere to \\ninternational treaties, to interpret them arbitrarily and \\nto observe international laws only when it serves one’s \\ninterest. A permanent member of the Security Council \\nshould be especially committed to fulfilling the \\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. That \\nforces us once more to conclude that, in the interests of \\nthe international community, it is imperative to \\nimprove the capacity of the United Nations to regulate \\nand resolve conflicts. Looking at recent events, it has \\nbecome quite clear how important it is to proceed with \\nthe reform of the Security Council.  \\n The previous month’s events in the southern \\nCaucasus raised another issue. Even before the armed \\n \\n \\n9 08-51839 \\n \\nconflict broke out, Georgia was the target of a \\ncyberwar aimed at Government websites, as well as \\nthose of news agencies and banks. In the case of \\ncyberattacks and cyberwarfare, it is becoming ever \\nmore difficult to determine and apprehend the \\nperpetrators. As I stated last year from this very \\nrostrum, cyberattacks are an international problem — \\nindeed, a form of aggression — that no nation is able \\nto deal with on its own. Cyberattacks can be launched \\nagainst any nation on any continent, and from any \\ncontinent.  \\n Administering and policing the cyberworld to \\navoid criminal and hostile attacks requires extensive \\ncooperation and the standardization of relevant \\ninternational regulations. I call upon all United Nations \\nMember nations to deal with the risks associated with \\ncybersecurity with the utmost seriousness. Estonia, \\nwhich has extensive experience dealing with and \\nrepulsing cyberattacks, is ready to contribute its \\nexpertise to thwarting that new form of criminal \\nwarfare. ',\n",
       " 'First, I would like to \\nexpress my great respect to the leadership of the \\nGeneral Assembly as it guides the Organization \\nthrough global issues and challenges.  \\n When I stood at this podium 10 years ago, the list \\nof issues to be urgently addressed was about the same, \\nyet the mood was different. The Kyoto Protocol had \\njust been signed and preparations for the Millennium \\nSummit, including the drafting of the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals, were under way. The international \\ncommunity, guided by the principles and the leadership \\nof the United Nations, showed the will and the \\nambition to resolve global issues.  \\n But did we manage to turn that collective will \\ninto principled and decisive actions? I have to admit \\nthat many nations, big and small, have many more \\nconcerns today than they did a decade ago. Today we \\nfeel less secure. The very structure of the international \\nsystem seems to be fracturing, depriving us of the \\nprotection provided by international law and \\ninternational institutions. In my region, in Eastern \\nEurope and in the eastern neighbourhood of the \\nEuropean Union (EU), that is more obvious than \\nanywhere else.  \\n \\n \\n7 08-51606 \\n \\n Take energy security: oil supplies to Lithuania \\nhave been cut off without warning, and we do not stand \\na chance of conducting a normal civilized dialogue on \\nhow to fix the problem. Gas supplies were interrupted \\nto our neighbours Ukraine and Belarus. In that light, \\nand on the eve of closing down our only independent \\npower generator, we have very serious reason to worry \\nabout the possible risks for the future of our economy. \\nI would also say that other countries of our region also \\nhave concerns about unreliable energy supplies. Such a \\nsituation threatens the stability of the entire region. The \\nUnited Nations cannot be a mere passive observer if, \\nand when, universal values and international law are \\nunder threat. Too often, we remain observers in the \\nface of mounting security crises.  \\n What happened to Georgia a few months ago is a \\ncase in point. The United Nations largely failed to react \\nto an act of aggression against a small nation that has \\nbeen a Member of the United Nations since 1992. \\nPerhaps we failed to react because one of the interested \\nsides to the conflict is a permanent member of the \\nSecurity Council, which has the responsibility to \\nprotect both the letter and the spirit of the Charter of \\nthe United Nations and various United Nations \\nresolutions. \\n But maybe we also failed to react because our \\nfaith in the United Nations has weakened. It is the very \\nessence of the Organization’s mission to protect human \\nlife and human rights, but too often voting on human \\nrights receives less and less support from Member \\nStates. Today, there are still about 26 million internally \\ndisplaced persons in the world, including in the Sudan, \\nSomalia, the South Caucasus nations of Georgia and \\nAzerbaijan, and other places. Last year alone, we faced \\nserious crises in different corners of the planet, \\nincluding in Myanmar, the Sudan and Zimbabwe. The \\nworld needed United Nations leadership, but the \\nOrganization has not acted accordingly. That is because \\nsome States hide behind technicalities or the shield of \\nnational sovereignty, thereby paralysing the United \\nNations. \\n It is quite evident that the United Nations cannot \\ncontinue with business as usual. It needs reform and a \\ngreater role in areas that will determine the future of \\nthe twenty-first century, such as energy, information \\nsecurity, anti-terrorism, the fight against \\nfundamentalism and the like. How long will we \\ncontinue with cold-war-era security definitions, closing \\nour eyes to the less visible, but no less dangerous \\ndangers of the twenty-first century? When 17 years \\nago, following the Soviet occupation, my country \\nregained independence and joined the United Nations, \\nwe were told that never again would Molotovs and \\nRibbentrops dare to decide the future of other nations. \\nNext year we will mark the seventieth anniversary of \\nthe shameful Molotov-Ribbentrop secret protocols.  \\n But Lithuania and other nations of the former \\nSoviet Union still have to fight against the revisionism \\nseeping down from the Kremlin’s towers and the \\nblatant claims that there was no occupation of the \\nBaltic States and that there was no Holodomor in \\nUkraine, where millions of people were starved to \\ndeath by a ruthless dictator. Should not an alarm bell \\nring across the entire international community when \\nwe see such bold attempts to cover up crimes against \\nhumanity? \\n Today, my nation is commemorating the Day of \\nGenocide of Lithuanian Jews. That tragedy is a \\npowerful reminder to us all of the vulnerability of \\nfreedom, but it also teaches us that sincere efforts to \\nadmit one’s crimes help nations to reconcile and create \\na truly peaceful, secure and stable area. Therefore, on \\nthis solemn day we not only remember but we also \\nlearn. \\n If we are to reform the United Nations in a \\nmeaningful way, perhaps we should have a better look \\nat the experience of European nations after the end of \\nthe Second World War and the end of the cold war. \\nBased on that experience, it is obvious that we need to \\nstrengthen democracy at home in order to have good \\ngovernance and responsible leadership. Perhaps \\nresponsible leaders will not protect us from all global \\nchallenges, but they will at least seek cooperation with \\ntheir people and other nations to resolve their \\npersisting problems. \\n It is only through integration that truly indivisible \\nsecurity can be achieved. Indivisible security has \\nspecial meaning and importance for smaller nations, \\nwhich have all too often fallen victim to the redrawing \\nof maps. It is my conviction that the interaction of, and \\ncooperation among, different organizations — like the \\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, \\nEU, NATO and the Council of Europe — have been, \\nand should remain, the foundation for security and \\nstability in Europe. There are difficulties and \\ndeficiencies; but there is no alternative, and new \\nalternatives are not needed. I am therefore deeply \\n  \\n \\n08-51606 8 \\n \\nworried by new calls to revise the institutional \\nstructure of European security, rather than to abide by \\ncommitments undertaken before the whole \\ninternational community. \\n Security based on cooperation should remain the \\nbasic principle of different European organizations and \\nof international relations as a whole. The philosophy of \\nthe balance of power, which is again growing popular \\nin some capitals, has no place in contemporary Europe. \\nAnd because security is indivisible, it is in the interest \\nof the international community that the United Nations \\nshould play a greater role in strengthening preventive \\ndiplomacy and making the principle of the \\nresponsibility to protect work. \\n The United Nations also has to be more \\nresponsive to emerging threats, such as unreliable \\nenergy supplies, fundamentalism and cyber attacks. It \\ndoes not matter if the world is unipolar, bipolar or \\nmultipolar. Human life and human rights remain at the \\nheart of our world. Only such a world can create a truly \\nviable architecture among States — an architecture \\nbased on trust, openness and respect for human rights. \\nBut did we see efforts to create such an architecture in \\nthe Georgia-Russia conflict? What we saw instead \\nwere renewed attempts to divide the world into zones \\nof influence or privileged interests. That should be \\nunacceptable to the international community in the \\ntwenty-first century. Division and exclusion are bad \\nremedies for conflict resolution. Conflict resolution in \\nSouth Ossetia, Abkhazia and elsewhere should \\ntherefore be the responsibility of the international \\ncommunity and international institutions, not of one \\nparticipating side, which hardly remains impartial. \\n We also have to maintain commitments to value-\\nbased policies. It is through our commitment to change \\nand reform that Lithuania has become what it is today: \\na consolidated democracy, a strong reformed economy \\nand an active contributor to international peacekeeping \\nmissions from the Balkans to Afghanistan. \\n I believe that we, the peoples of the United \\nNations, have to renew our commitment to universal \\nvalues and principles, so that we march together and in \\nthe same direction and our steps become stronger. I \\nbelieve that we must learn those lessons well, so that in \\nanother 10-years’ time we can celebrate not only the \\nfulfilled promise of the Millennium Development \\nGoals but also the fulfilled promise of creating lasting \\npeace and an era of progress, prosperity and human \\nintegrity. It is because the United Nations consists \\nprimarily not of the sum total of votes but of universal \\nprinciples that those principles shall be a guiding light \\nfor us in the years to come. I still believe that that is \\nthe core mission of the Organization. I care deeply \\nabout it. ',\n",
       " 'Over the past year, I, like many \\nothers in this Hall, have spoken about the effect of the \\ncurrent global financial crisis on our people and the \\nneed for an effective national or international response. \\nAlthough the crisis is closely related to issues such as \\npeace and security, human rights, development and \\nmany other matters of common concern, we cannot let \\nit cast a shadow over all the global challenges that we \\ncurrently face. \\n Today, a year after the collapse of the financial \\nmarkets, cyclical indicators point to economic \\nstabilization. The crisis is not over, however, and the \\nneed to restore confidence and repair the financial \\nsystem remains. Moreover, each of us should make an \\neffort to refrain from raising new barriers and avoid \\nlaying the foundations for new global imbalances in \\nthe longer run. \\n In combating climate change, we have finally \\nunderstood the magnitude of our task and I would like \\nto thank the Secretary-General for hosting the Summit \\non Climate Change a few days ago. We are not running \\na 100-metre sprint, but rather a marathon, where one \\nmust maintain speed. If we manage to stay on track we \\nall shall be winners in the end. But time is running out. \\nMelting glaciers, frequent and abnormally large \\nhurricanes, floods and heat waves — this is not the \\nplanet that we want to leave to our children. \\n Global and united efforts are needed to reach a \\ncomprehensive and ambitious post-2012 climate \\nagreement in Copenhagen this December. I call upon \\nall countries to set binding goals to share the burden. \\nResponsibility must be proportional to the harm that is \\ncaused. I am convinced that applying the “polluter-\\npays” principle would motivate the biggest polluters to \\nmultiply their efforts and would therefore have the \\ngreatest effect. \\n Green energy production, renewable energy, \\nenergy efficiency and diversification of energy \\nsources — all these contribute not only to sustainable \\nenvironmental and economic development but also to \\nour security, as we will become less dependent on \\nexhaustible fossil fuels. \\n As an essential part of cutting greenhouse gas \\nemissions, we foresee a wider use of renewable energy \\nin Estonia, particularly biomass and wind energy. By \\nthe end of the year, an Estonian Energy and Climate \\nAgency will be established to help consumers cut \\nenergy expenditures and support building energy-\\nefficient homes. This is but one example of how an \\nambitious climate policy can be used to trigger new \\ngrowth in the economy. \\n To uphold the core of the United Nations Charter, \\nwe must remain committed to providing the United \\nNations with sufficient resources to fulfil its unique \\nrole in contributing to international security. \\nCompliance with the basic principles enshrined in the \\nCharter, including the obligation of all Members to \\nrefrain from the threat or use of force against the \\nterritorial integrity or political independence of any \\nState, must remain the fundamental basis of the United \\nNations agenda. The United Nations should remain \\nengaged in areas of tension where it can make a \\ncontribution. \\n My delegation takes this opportunity to reiterate \\nits firm support for the security and stability of \\nGeorgia, based on full respect for the principles of \\nindependence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. \\n I follow with deep concern the situation in \\nAfghanistan. It is essential that the election process \\ndeliver results that are legitimate in the eyes of the \\nAfghans. The future of Afghanistan lies in the hands of \\nthe Afghan people; we, the international community, \\ncan only help. By consolidating the efforts of the new \\nGovernment and the international community, lasting \\nprogress can and should be achieved. Estonia is one of \\nthe countries that have steadily increased their military \\nand civilian contribution to Afghanistan. \\n I am convinced that the bolstered role and greater \\nvisibility of the United Nations throughout the country \\nhas a positive impact on the coordination of \\ndevelopment activities that in turn will attract more \\n  \\n \\n09-52463 10 \\n \\nnon-governmental organizations and other international \\norganizations to the area. \\n Besides conflicts between and inside States, new \\nand asymmetrical cross-border threats have also \\nemerged: the threat from the Internet, for example. \\nCyber threats not only endanger vital information \\ntechnology systems but they endanger entire \\ncommunities. Concurrently with the rapid development \\nof computer technology we are witnessing alarming \\nsigns of more sinister developments: cyber attacks are \\ngrowing more complex and are increasing in \\nfrequency. Consequently, major cooperative efforts by \\nboth the governmental and the private sectors are \\nrequired to develop more effective response \\ncapabilities. \\n This growing global concern demands both a \\nbetter coordinated international approach and an \\nenhanced legal domestic framework, including steps to \\ncriminalize malevolent cyber acts. Our long-term aim \\nshould be the creation of a universal cyber culture — a \\nuniversally accessible, secure and safe environment for \\nall. \\n Regarding humanitarian affairs, our task is \\nequally challenging. Global ecological instability, \\npolitical and military conflicts, combined with \\neconomic instability and population growth, are \\nexpected to increase humanitarian needs considerably \\nand require that our efforts be multiplied in the future. \\nWe must stand ready to provide a more predictable, \\nequitable and consistently effective response to \\nhumanitarian crises. The growing needs require an \\nincrease in the amount of assistance, in coordination \\nand in the range of donors. \\n True, we all have economic concerns at the \\nmoment, but it is vital to keep our commitments to \\nproviding humanitarian relief. Today’s short-sighted \\nfinancial decisions or fading political will may in the \\nend become far more expensive and entail severe long-\\nterm consequences. \\n I would like to commend the excellent work done \\nby the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian \\nAffairs and Member States in making the coordination \\namong humanitarian workers more efficient and \\nimplementing the cluster system. The launch of the \\nCentral Emergency Response Fund three years ago has \\nalso proven a justified effort in providing more rapid \\nand equitable response allocations to disaster-affected \\nareas. As Estonia, together with Ireland, currently \\nco-chairs the Good Humanitarian Donorship initiative, \\nwe urge all donors to apply the principles of good \\nhumanitarian donorship to make humanitarian aid more \\nneeds-based and its financing more flexible. \\n As a sign of the priority we give to global \\nhumanitarian issues, Estonia this year holds a vice-\\npresidency of the Economic and Social Council and \\nhas been leading humanitarian discussions in that body. \\nI am concerned that in many humanitarian situations, \\nespecially in conflict situations, adherence to \\nhumanitarian principles has become selective, \\nhindering safe and timely access to victims. I fully \\nconcur with Under-Secretary-General John Holmes \\nthat this is not an ideological luxury but a practical \\nnecessity to help ensure timely access as well as the \\nsafety and security of humanitarian staff. \\n It goes without saying that expectations are \\nhigher during trying times, and therefore the United \\nNations actions in carrying out its objectives have \\nincreasingly come under scrutiny. Yet, how is the \\nOrganization to live up to those high expectations \\nwhen the United Nations is struggling to reform itself? \\nOver the past years, Member States have undertaken \\nconsiderable efforts to improve the United Nations \\nsystem, while one important element, Security Council \\nreform, still remains pending. While recognizing that \\nthe reform process is complex, we must also realize \\nthat there will be severe consequences if the process \\nremains incomplete. \\n Regarding another reform area — gender \\nreform — considerable progress that is also relevant to \\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals has been \\nmade recently. No security, development or human \\nrights-related goal can be achieved without the full \\nparticipation of women. Estonia has been a dedicated \\nsupporter of the United Nations funds and programmes \\nthat foster gender equality. It is our common obligation \\nto ensure that reform becomes a reality without delay. \\n Facing the first financial crisis of the twenty-first \\ncentury and the accelerating global warming process, \\nwe see the necessity for a united response growing. \\nThis is why we, the leaders of all nations, once again \\nhave gathered here this week: to remind ourselves to \\nkeep our eyes on the horizon of peace and prosperity \\nand to make sure that we are in the same boat.',\n",
       " 'I am pleased to address the \\nGeneral Assembly. This year, I shall focus on three \\npressing global matters: the progress in achieving the \\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), promoting \\npeace and security, and humanitarian affairs. \\n During the first decade of this millennium, the \\nMDGs have triggered a level of global commitment \\nand wide-ranging partnership that the world has never \\nseen before. Along the way, there have been setbacks, \\nof course. One thing, however, is certain — achieving \\nthe MDGs is an attainable reality with concrete targets \\nand deadlines. \\n We have set a clear goal, but we must keep in \\nmind that we shall reach our objective only if we share \\nthe weight of responsibility and all of us pull in the \\nsame direction. The political will expressed by a \\nmajority of stakeholders at the recent MDG summit \\nand in its outcome document (resolution 65/1) needs to \\nbe implemented promptly, in accordance with the \\nagreed action agenda. Only five years, after all, remain. \\nEstonia is ready to provide continuous contributions to \\nthe success of our common endeavour. \\n Estonia contributes towards the achievement of \\nthe MDGs through focused development cooperation \\npolicy and respective activities in our main partner \\ncountries, one of which is Afghanistan. Alongside with \\nproviding security through the International Security \\nAssistance Force (ISAF), we are carrying out long-\\nterm health care and education projects in Helmand \\nprovince. We also offer our best practices in \\n  \\n \\n10-54965 24 \\n \\nestablishing standards of good governance, including \\nthe creation of an electronic voting system for the \\nnewly elected Parliament. \\n Estonia supports the transition process, including \\nthe gradual transfer of security responsibilities to the \\nAfghan authorities. This process should be term-based \\nand irreversible, and carried out according to the \\nagreement reached at the ISAF meeting in Tallinn last \\nApril. Ownership of the process on the part of the \\nAfghan Government is crucial in taking forward the \\npledge it made at the Kabul Conference with regard to \\nstrengthening the electoral framework. This, along with \\nthe endorsed reform agenda, demonstrates the Afghans’ \\ndesire to develop their nation. \\n For my country, Estonia, the development of \\ninformation and communications technology has been \\na crucial engine of economic development and \\nmodernization throughout the past 20 years. This is \\nwhy our experts advise Governments on information \\nand communications technology solutions in many \\nparts of the world. In cooperation with the United \\nNations Development Programme and the Open \\nSociety Institute, we have established a special \\nacademy to assist Governments in developing countries \\nwith advice and training in electronic governance and \\nthe use of information and communications technology \\nin public services. I am convinced that the more \\nsuccessful we are in reducing the digital divide, the \\nmore accelerated and more sustainable overall \\neconomic progress will be. \\n I commend United Nations efforts in paving the \\nway towards a more efficient operational system, \\nespecially the long-awaited outcome of the four-year \\nsystem-wide coherence negotiations. As the \\nimplications of gender inequality affect all the \\nMillennium Development Goals, the consensus \\nagreement on establishing the United Nations Entity \\nfor Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women \\n(UN Women) will serve as an extra boost for meeting \\nthose Goals. \\n Estonia contributes to the achievement of the \\nMillennium Goals through the respective United \\nNations agencies, funds and programmes, and we \\npledge our support to UN Women as well. \\n Ever since the United Nations Charter was \\nsigned, 65 years ago, the United Nations has stood for \\nglobal peace and security. The United Nations \\npeacekeeping budget has increased more than 15-fold \\nsince 1991. It is difficult to imagine the situation in \\nmajor crisis areas, such as the Sudan and the \\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, without the active, \\nmultifaceted engagement of the United Nations. With \\nits 15 military and 12 political operations, however, the \\nUnited Nations peacekeeping force is clearly stretched \\nthin. We need further reforms in order to enhance the \\neffectiveness of peacekeeping operations and to \\nencourage regional actors to assume a stronger role. \\nEstonia contributes to the United Nations peacekeeping \\nbudget at a voluntarily enhanced rate. We have done \\nthis for 10 years now and will continue to do so. \\n The credibility of the United Nations in the \\npromotion of peace and security depends on the \\ncommitment of all Member States. We all share equally \\nthe responsibility to apply the principles enshrined in \\nthe Charter, including the duty to refrain from any \\nthreat or use of force against the territorial integrity or \\npolitical independence of any State. \\n Estonia reiterates its firm support for the \\nsovereignty, territorial integrity, security and stability \\nof Georgia, on the basis of full adherence to \\ninternational law. For the peaceful resolution of that \\ndrawn-out conflict, it is necessary to continue the \\nGeneva talks in their initial format. Humanitarian \\nissues, in particular ensuring the safe and dignified \\nreturn of refugees and internally displaced persons, and \\nthe question of increased access to the conflict zone, \\nespecially for humanitarian workers and international \\nobservers, need to be seriously addressed now. \\nFurthermore, the free movement of people living \\nwithin the internationally recognized borders of \\nGeorgia must be ensured. \\n Without justice, efforts to ensure sustainable \\npeace might easily be wiped out. I would like, \\ntherefore, to emphasize the importance of the adoption \\nby consensus of a package of amendments on the crime \\nof aggression by the Review Conference of the Rome \\nStatute of the International Criminal Court, held in \\nJune 2010. Estonia strongly supports an international \\ncriminal justice system in which an independent and \\neffective International Criminal Court plays a central \\nrole. \\n It is also of crucial importance to support the \\nactivities of the International Criminal Tribunal for the \\nFormer Yugoslavia during its final years of existence. \\nEstonia is doing its share with respect to the \\nenforcement of sentences. \\n \\n \\n25 10-54965 \\n \\n Success in confronting the security challenges of \\nthe twenty-first century, including cyberthreats, \\ndepends on close cooperation among all States and \\ninternational and regional organizations. Estonia urges \\nbroad cross-border and cross-sector capacity-building \\nin protecting critical information infrastructure, the \\nimportance of which was highlighted in the report of \\nthe high-level panel of experts on information and \\ncommunication technology (A/55/75). The necessity of \\ncloser cooperation among States, between the private \\nsector and civil society, is critical, since during a cyber \\nattack all traditional security measures may be \\nrendered useless. I can assure you that all-\\nencompassing preparedness will pay off when a real \\ncrisis strikes. \\n Estonia remains actively engaged in areas where \\nour contribution can make a difference, particularly in \\nhumanitarian affairs and human rights issues. In this \\ncontext, I would like to draw attention to the tenth \\nanniversary of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) \\non women, peace and security, which must be a \\nstepping stone towards further action at the United \\nNations, regional and national levels. Establishing \\noperational guidelines for the protection of women and \\ngirls, strengthening accountability mechanisms and \\nenhancing women’s participation in peace negotiations \\nand post-conflict peacebuilding should be part of these \\nefforts. To this end, Estonia is finalizing a national \\naction plan to enhance our activities. \\nEstonia is a strong and principled advocate of \\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, including the \\nfreedom of expression. Estonia supports the \\nstrengthening of the Human Rights Council and its \\ncapacity to promote and protect human rights around \\nthe world. We aspire to join the Human Rights Council \\nin 2012. \\n Estonia has also continuously increased its \\ncontribution to United Nations humanitarian activities, \\nboth through work in the field and financially. The \\nUnited Nations coordination capability was crucial \\nmost recently in Pakistan and at the beginning of the \\nyear in Haiti, where it saved lives, and where Estonian \\nlogistics experts have been supporting United Nations \\nactivities on the ground for more than six months now. \\nOur experience has made clear the need for more \\ncombined efforts in securing the link between relief \\nefforts and development work. \\n Estonia is concerned about increasingly frequent \\nviolations of humanitarian principles in conflict zones. \\nAlas, humanitarian emblems and flags no longer \\nprovide the shield of protection they used to. We must \\nstep up our efforts and press for increased security for \\nhumanitarian aid workers. After all, it is the \\nresponsibility of Governments to ensure the safety and \\nsecurity of humanitarian personnel working on their \\nterritory. \\n The effectiveness of humanitarian aid and \\nupholding good humanitarian principles are other \\nconcerns of ours. Advocating these principles was one \\nof the activities Estonia pursued during our recent co-\\nchairmanship of the Good Humanitarian Donorship \\ninitiative. \\n Finally, I would like to underline one simple \\ntruth. The United Nations, like any other organization, \\nis only as strong and effective as the political will and \\ncommitment of its members. Big or small, we all bear \\nresponsibility. As a member of the European Union, \\nEstonia firmly believes that the Treaty of Lisbon \\nfundamentally enhances the ability of the Union to be a \\nsignificant global actor, securing peace, stability and \\nprosperity for all. With our shared commitment, I \\nexpect the vital and prominent role of the United \\nNations in the global arena to be further reinforced.',\n",
       " 'The nations \\nrepresented here know how deeply the world has \\nchanged in the six and a half decades since the United \\nNations was formed; since the spirit of international \\ncitizenship, of peoples and nations combining their \\nenergies to solve our shared problems, gave birth to the \\nUnited Nations. Today, that spirit is needed more than \\never. \\n All of us have to respond to a world that is \\nprofoundly altered. As a community of nations, we face \\nthree profound challenges: a redrawing of the map of \\npower, including a big shift in economic power; the \\nglobalization of problems, not least terrorism and \\nclimate change; and increasingly fluid forms of identity \\nand the rapid circulation and potency of new ideas. \\nTaken together, these mean that we are in a new world. \\nAll three demand matching responses. So we must \\nreform and renew our multilateral institutions in line \\nwith the changing map of power, strengthen our actions \\non international peacebuilding, climate change and \\ndevelopment, and promote liberal values and human \\nrights to win the conflict of ideas. \\n The truth is that in all three of these areas we are \\nnot doing anything like as well as we must. The \\neffectiveness of multilateral approaches is in question \\nin the wake of the financial crisis, the failure of the \\nclimate change talks in Copenhagen and the stalling of \\nthe Doha Trade Round. And too many nations and \\ninternational institutions have been too reticent about \\npromoting enlightened human values. We need to inject \\nnew life into our institutions and new confidence into \\nthe expression of our ideals. \\n Turning first to the altered geography of power, it \\nis an often-stated fact that the old economic order is \\nbeing transformed and that what were once labelled \\nemerging economies are now, in many cases, global \\neconomic players. The distribution of military power, \\ntoo, is altering, so power is being wielded in different \\nplaces and in different ways. This power shift requires \\nus to reform our international institutions, to reinforce \\nthe rule of international law, and to free up \\ninternational trade. \\n In recent years, our multinational institutions \\nhave sometimes struggled to adapt to the new \\ncircumstances, so reform is essential. And a good place \\nto start is right here at the United Nations. The Security \\nCouncil must be reformed to reflect the new geography \\nof power. The United Kingdom is clear and \\nunambiguous in our support for permanent seats for \\nBrazil, India, Germany and Japan, and for African \\nrepresentation. Put simply, the United Nations cannot \\nspeak for the many if it only hears the voices of the \\nfew. We welcome the priority that the President has \\npromised to give to the Assembly’s continuing \\nnegotiations on this issue. \\n Closer cooperation on counter-terrorism is also \\nvital, and we welcome the Assembly’s affirmation of \\nthe United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. \\nWe must stand shoulder to shoulder in the struggle \\nagainst terrorism. \\n The United Kingdom will always champion the \\nUnited Nations. If it did not exist, we would have to \\ninvent it. But let us be frank. Without a radical \\noverhaul, the United Nations will not provide the \\nleadership the world seeks from it and needs from it. It \\nis also important that the vital role of the European \\nUnion in promoting development and prosperity be \\nadequately represented in the Assembly. \\n The redrawing of the power map also makes it \\neven more important that the writ of international law \\nextend across the world. Laws are the solid \\nrepresentation of our collective values. That is why it is \\nso important that we uphold and reinforce the \\ninstruments of international justice, including the \\nInternational Criminal Court and specific tribunals, \\nsuch as those for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.  \\n I strongly welcome the comments of President \\nObama yesterday on the vital importance of the Middle \\nEast peace process. I can assure the Assembly that the \\nUnited Kingdom is committed to helping lead to the \\nend of hostilities that have been so profoundly \\ndamaging for all sides. \\n The prevention of nuclear-weapons proliferation \\nis another huge priority for the international \\ncommunity. The United Kingdom welcomes the \\nsuccess of the Review Conference of the Parties to the \\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \\nthis May, and I can assure the Assembly that we will \\ncontinue to play our part in making the world safer \\nfrom the threat of nuclear weapons. \\n I was ready today to welcome the progress made \\nin this week’s meeting of the E3+3 group on Iran. I \\nwas ready to also straightforwardly reiterate our \\n \\n \\n27 10-54959 \\n \\nconcerns about Iran’s nuclear programme. But instead, \\nonce again, an issue of grave global concern has been \\novershadowed by the bizarre, offensive and attention-\\ngrabbing pronouncements by President Ahmadinejad \\nfrom this rostrum yesterday. His remarks were intended \\nto distract attention from Iran’s obligations and to \\ngenerate media headlines. They deserve to do neither. \\n The reshaped world of power also increases the \\nneed to open our borders to free trade. A trading world \\nis a safer world. A world trade deal, which is within \\nreach, would be worth $170 billion annually to the \\nworld economy. Two years ago we were very close, but \\nwe failed to seal the deal. We simply cannot afford \\nprotectionism. Today, we have to recognize that we \\nwill need an even more ambitious deal than we \\nenvisaged then if we are to get an agreement. Greater \\naccess to markets, particularly for least developed \\ncountries’ exports of agriculture, supports growth and \\nreduces poverty. \\n The second of the three big shifts we have to \\nadapt to is the globalization of many of our problems \\nand of many of the solutions to those problems. Our \\neconomies are, of course, tied ever more closely \\ntogether, as recent events have dramatically proven. \\nProsperity and poverty in one part of the world impact \\non economic activity and security elsewhere. \\n Diseases can span the globe in a matter of days. \\nTerrorism is conducted by international networks \\nacross the world. Environmental threats do not respect \\nborders. We are used to thinking about stateless people. \\nWe have to get used to the idea of stateless problems, \\ntoo. Conflict takes place between, across and within \\nnational boundaries, but wherever it takes place it can \\nthreaten the interests of all nations. Conflict \\nundermines our collective prosperity and destroys \\ndevelopment. We must work harder to prevent conflict \\nby tackling the sources of violence. And where conflict \\ndoes break out, we must be ready to help resolve it.  \\n So let me take this opportunity to acknowledge \\nthe invaluable contribution of United Nations \\npeacekeepers to laying the foundations for sustainable \\npeace around the world. We owe them all, and the \\nGovernments that provide them, a great debt of \\ngratitude. The United Kingdom, along with France and \\nother partners, has been at the forefront of supporting \\nand encouraging United Nations efforts to deliver more \\nstrategic and effective peacekeeping. We will continue \\nto provide that support.  \\n But peacekeeping alone is not the answer. We \\nneed peacebuilding, too. The United Nations is \\nuniquely placed not only to keep the peace, but also to \\nmake it last. Effective peacebuilding can address the \\nunderlying causes of conflict and strengthen local, \\nregional and national capacity to contribute to long-\\nterm stability in fragile States. \\n The coming year will see some significant \\nchallenges to the United Nations efforts to promote \\ninternational peace, justice and security: in the Sudan, \\nwhere we will see a referendum on the future of \\nSouthern Sudan, while continuing to look for progress \\non justice in Darfur and more widely; in Somalia, \\nwhere the African Union peacekeeping mission is \\nplaying a brave and crucial role, and where the \\nleadership of the United Nations could be decisive; and \\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where much \\nprogress has been made but where we have seen again \\nin recent weeks how much more remains to be done to \\nachieve real security and stability for many of its hard-\\npressed people. \\n The United Kingdom remains fully committed to \\nthe mission to bring peace and prosperity to \\nAfghanistan. Afghans are increasingly taking \\nresponsibility for their own affairs. This year’s Kabul \\nConference and, most recently, parliamentary elections \\nhave demonstrated Afghan commitment. Challenges \\nremain, but progress is being made. The United \\nKingdom will continue to work with its international \\npartners to support Afghans to build a better \\nAfghanistan. \\n The United Kingdom is wholehearted in our \\nsupport for international development. Like many \\nnations, we are having to take tough action to reduce \\nour financial deficits, but we are not budging a \\nmillimetre from our commitment to development. We \\nare standing by our promise to devote 0.7 per cent of \\ngross national income to international development \\nassistance from 2013, and we will enshrine this \\ncommitment in law. \\n When disaster strikes, we must respond quickly \\nand generously. Right now, Pakistan faces a \\nhumanitarian disaster of unimaginable proportions. As \\nthe Secretary-General has said, this is the largest \\ndisaster in the 65-year history of the United Nations. \\nSo we must ensure that the United Nations appeal is \\nproperly funded to cover both humanitarian relief and \\nreconstruction, and we must ensure that there is enough \\n  \\n \\n10-54959 28 \\n \\nsupport over the long term, not least in helping \\nPakistan to achieve the levels of economic growth that \\nwill allow the country to rebuild itself. I am very \\nproud, as the representative of a European Union (EU) \\nmember State, that the EU has recently shown real \\nleadership in promising to look at improving trade \\naccess for Pakistan in response to the disaster. I very \\nmuch hope that others can follow suit. \\n So, economic power has shifted and problems \\nhave globalized, but at the same time the power of \\nideas has grown enormously. Identities have become \\nmore fluid. It is not possible to put people into neatly \\nlabelled national boxes any more. This means that \\nwinning the battle of ideas is as important as military \\nprowess. \\n The work of international institutions must \\ncontinue to be guided by the values on which those \\ninstitutions were founded: the rule of law, both \\ndomestic and international; the right to freedom of \\nexpression and belief; democracy; and equality before \\nthe law. These values are sometimes described as \\nWestern values, but only by people who do not know \\ntheir history. Four centuries ago, the great Mughal \\nemperor Akbar was legislating for religious freedom \\nand equality in what is now India, while in parts of \\nEurope heretics were being burned at the stake. The \\ntruth is that these liberal values of equality, law and \\nself-determination cannot be claimed by any nation or \\nhemisphere. They are global values with global force. \\nThey are also the values at the heart of the United \\nNations Charter. \\n We should never apologize for promoting the idea \\nthat women and men are equal; never flinch from \\ninsisting that Governments chosen by their people are \\nbetter; never shy away from our insistence that nobody \\nshould be silenced because of their religion or beliefs. \\n The United Kingdom will therefore continue to \\npush for human rights across the world. Since the \\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted in \\n1948, the United Nations has developed a global legal \\nframework of human rights standards. We want to see \\nthe Human Rights Council do more to ensure that \\nStates implement their obligations and use the 2011 \\nreview to improve the Council’s ability to respond \\neffectively to situations of concern, such as the \\noutrageous abuse of democracy and human rights in \\nBurma. \\n United Kingdom foreign policy will be shaped by \\nthe three big challenges I have set out today: a power \\nshift, the globalization of problems, and the rapid \\ncirculation and potency of ideas. The United Kingdom \\nGovernment will fearlessly promote our ideals and \\ninterests while remaining realistic in our approach. \\n This is the spirit in which the United Kingdom \\nGovernment is conducting a root-and-branch review of \\nour own strategic defence and security policy. Our last \\nreview took place in 1998, but the world has changed, \\nalong with the character of the threats we face. This is \\nnot to say that we did not face grave threats before, but \\nthey were more fixed, more visible and more \\npredictable. Today, the threats to our security are not \\nrooted in specific States. They are more fluid and often \\nless visible: terrorism, organized crime, or attacks from \\ncyberspace. We must judge our security not by our \\nability to deal with what we know, but how able we are \\nto respond to unpredictable threats. \\n The United Kingdom will also show leadership \\nby example. As fierce advocates of the international \\nrule of law, we will practice what we preach. No nation \\ncan insist on the law and then act as though it is above \\nit. But our approach will also be hard-headed and \\nrealistic. In recent years we have learned — in same \\ncases the hard way — that democracy cannot be \\ncreated by diktat. Freedom cannot be commanded into \\nexistence. \\n The new coalition Government, now five-months \\nold, will restore Britain’s international reputation by \\npursuing a hard-headed foreign policy based on liberal \\nvalues.  \\n The world has changed, but the values that should \\nguide us have not. We have to renew our international \\ninstitutions in line with the new realities of world \\npower and influence, and fearlessly project the ideals \\nof democracy, equality and freedom. Great things are \\ndemanded of us. Great things are necessary from us. It \\nfalls to our generation of leaders to meet these \\nchallenges together.',\n",
       " 'I would first of all like to \\ncongratulate Ambassador Al-Nasser on assuming the \\npresidency of the General Assembly.  \\n The twentieth anniversary this year of the \\nrestoration of Estonia’s independence, not surprisingly, \\ncoincides with our twentieth year of membership in the \\nUnited Nations and our participation in the General \\nAssembly. Given where we were then, in 1991 — a \\npoor and beleaguered country, brutalized by a half-\\ncentury of thuggish Soviet, then Nazi, and then again \\nSoviet occupation — our transformation in one \\ngeneration to a modern, technologically cutting-edge \\nEuropean democracy is a testament to what a \\ncommitted people can do. It is, as well, a challenge to \\nthose who find excuses for not implementing \\n \\n \\n47 11-50692 \\n \\ndemocracy, for not eliminating corruption and for \\ncontinuing to brutalize their citizens. \\n Today, 20 years after the bumbling coup and \\nensuing crumbling of that rusty edifice of \\ntotalitarianism, the Soviet Union, we again smell in the \\nair the hope of liberty and democracy — this time in \\nthe Middle East and North Africa. Again people have \\ncome together and said, “Enough!” — of the lies, the \\ncorruption and the 3 a.m. knock on the door by the \\ndull-brained goons of the secret police. People want to \\nbe able to speak their minds and to run their own lives, \\nfree of harassment, or worse, by the authorities. In a \\nword, people want democracy. They want, too, the \\nfoundations of democracy: respect for human rights, \\nthe rule of law and the freedom of speech and \\nassembly. \\n With those hopes in the hearts of so many people \\nin this year of otherwise dismal and tawdry news, \\nEstonia welcomes — indeed wholeheartedly \\nencourages — the United Nations to move forward on \\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s decision to focus \\nduring his second term on democracy and human \\nrights. Estonia welcomes that decision because, \\nfrankly, the results of the democracy movements of a \\ngeneration ago have not even come close to what we \\nhoped for at the time. Most of the people who lived \\nunder undemocratic rule two decades ago continue to \\ndo so today. Of what was the Soviet Union then, only \\nEstonia, Latvia and Lithuania have earned the \\ndesignation “free” in Freedom House’s annual report \\ncard on the rule of law, respect for fundamental \\nfreedoms and free and fair elections. That, I submit, is \\na poor result. \\n Each country and each situation is of course \\ndifferent. No textbook rules can tell us how to make \\ndemocracy work or how to build a prosperous society. \\nA few basic tenets and lessons, however, hold across \\nnations, experiences and cultures. The United Nations \\nown Universal Declaration of Human Rights — a \\ndocument everyone here is obliged to adhere to — \\nafter all, is based on the premise of common truths held \\nby all. \\n Democracy, as I said, is not only about voting and \\nfree and fair elections, vital though they are for any \\nfree and democratic society. Respect for human rights \\nand the rule of law constitute the cornerstones of an \\nopen society. If one cannot speak their mind or be \\nguaranteed a fair trial if arrested, it matters little that \\nthey can go to the polling booth. Rights and freedoms \\nbelong to each and every person. They are not the \\nprivilege of a select few with the money, the guns or \\nthe power. \\n For Estonia, it is of fundamental importance that \\nthe North African and Middle Eastern revolutions have \\nbeen popular reactions to sustained violations of \\nhuman rights, corruption and injustice. The revolutions \\nconfirm the universal aspiration to realize one’s human \\nrights. They show once again, as throughout history, \\nthat people naturally want to be free from fear and \\nrepression. Notice I said people, not “men”. As long \\nago as 2,500 years ago, Aristotle noted that where “the \\nstate of women is bad, almost half of human life is \\nspoilt”. This is no less true today and will remain so. \\nThe ongoing revolutions could not have occurred and \\ncannot succeed without women.  \\n It is a profound source of concern to Estonia to \\nnotice that, while women are welcome to protest \\nagainst corrupt regimes, they are not always welcome \\nto participate in the political process. Estonia therefore \\nplaces great hopes on the United Nations new gender \\nentity, UN-Women, and will continue to insist that the \\nUnited Nations as a whole do its part globally by \\nstanding up for women’s rights. We also expect that \\nUN-Women will play an active role in helping to take \\nthe principles of Security Council resolution 1325 \\n(2000) on women and peace and security from paper to \\nreality. \\n For as long as we have lived as a free nation, \\nEstonia has always protected and promoted human \\nrights and fundamental freedoms at home and abroad. \\nOur candidature to the Human Rights Council is a \\nlogical consequence of our work, but it is certainly not \\nthe culmination as we continue to live up to our \\nnational and international obligations. \\n Once again, ongoing events underline the need \\nfor us to focus on the protection of civilians from \\natrocities. Even in the democratic part of my continent, \\nthe political project we today call the European Union \\nwas a reaction to mass murder and war. The very \\nhistory of Europe motivates us to take preventive steps \\nto avoid any repetition of such crimes. Therefore, it is \\nvital that we develop common practices and the \\ncapacity to implement the principle of the \\nresponsibility to protect. Protecting civilians from \\natrocities, dear colleagues, is not just about protection. \\n  \\n \\n11-50692 48 \\n \\nIt also means bringing the perpetrators of crimes and \\natrocities against civilians to justice.  \\n International law, in particular the International \\nCriminal Court, and the understanding that justice will \\nbe done, no matter how long it takes, are the tools we \\npossess to prevent the worst human rights violations. \\nThe rule of law and respect for international law are \\nwhat will help ravaged and victimized societies to \\nregain their dignity and rebuild their communities. The \\ncommon efforts of the international community, the \\nInternational Criminal Court and its States parties \\nremain a priority for my country. \\n While focusing on the pertinent issues of the \\npresent, we must not shy away from addressing the \\nunresolved issues of the recent past. Afghanistan is one \\nof those. Establishing lasting security there remains a \\nkey objective for Estonia. To reach that objective, we \\nmust focus on assisting Afghan efforts to further \\ndevelop good governance and the rule of law. Along \\nwith human rights, these are the crucial elements of a \\nsustainable society. We believe that we must all remain \\ncommitted as long as is necessary to reach this goal. To \\nthat end, Estonia will continue to support the access of \\nAfghans, in particular women and children, to health \\ncare and education through its development \\ncooperation projects. \\n Georgia is another country that continues to \\nrequire our attention. The 2008 war ended with the \\nviolation of Georgian territorial integrity, which is a \\nfundamental violation of international law that remains \\nunresolved to this day. The fundamental principles of \\ninternational law must be followed by all members of \\nthe international community and not just the small, \\nwho have no other recourse. Additionally, we should \\ncontinue to support the Geneva talks. The United \\nNations involvement is of the utmost importance and \\nmust continue in the future. \\n Here today in the United Nations, our attention is \\nalso focused on Israel and Palestine. A viable two-State \\nsolution must take into consideration the legitimate \\nconcerns of both sides for their well-being, safety and \\nprosperity. \\n Another security- and human rights-related topic \\nis the Internet, especially these days, when it has come \\nto play such an important role in democratization by \\nenabling political discussion and mobilizing popular \\nmovements. The Internet has grown beyond all \\nexpectations since people began to use it regularly \\nsome 20 years ago. Its global, ipso facto cross-border \\nnature allows users the world over to access \\ninformation and ideas, to communicate with each other \\nand to learn. Estonia firmly believes that States should \\nensure that their people can freely seek, receive and \\nimpart information and ideas and have access to the \\nInternet. In fact, Estonia believes that, in this \\ntechnological age, unimpeded access to the Internet is a \\nhuman right. \\n A transparent Government and administration, a \\nliberal economic environment and a strong educational \\nsystem all have contributed to Estonia’s success. \\nEstonia’s development over the past 20 years is proof \\nthat information and communications technology can \\nbe a springboard to success for all States. We are quite \\nwilling to continue to share our experience, especially \\nin increasing transparency and openness in \\nGovernment, with other countries. \\n The Internet, however, poses many dangers as \\nwell. Increasingly disruptive cyberthreats and attacks \\nthat can seriously harm entire communities and, \\nindeed, cause harm to countless individuals, are a new \\ndanger that we face. The large-scale cyberattacks \\nagainst Estonia in 2007 created a new awareness \\namong our people. The steps Estonia has taken towards \\na more secure Internet, however, do not restrict our \\npeople’s freedoms. In fact, Freedom House’s global \\nassessment of Freedom on the Net 2011 rated Estonia \\nas the freest in the world, demonstrating that a proper \\nbalance between rights and security can be found \\nwithout compromising either. \\n We also bear responsibility for the environment \\nwe live in. It was no accident that the democratic \\nrevolutions of Central and Eastern Europe were \\naccompanied, and indeed often instigated, by \\nenvironmental movements. Citizens had become fed up \\nwith the totalitarian system’s abuse of nature and \\ndisregard for human beings. Ignoring the state of its \\ncitizens’ health and surroundings, the totalitarian State \\nexposed itself to be what it was — a self-serving clique \\nhell-bent on maintaining its power, no matter what the \\ncost to its people, no matter what pain and suffering \\nensued. \\n Today, the challenge we face is global. It is \\nclimate change. Estonia’s 2010 national security \\nconcept states that climate change is also a security \\nissue and can have a destabilizing effect. Estonia \\nalready has decided to contribute to the fast-track \\n \\n \\n49 11-50692 \\n \\nfinancing of efforts to combat climate change. We \\nbelieve that sustainable development and the green \\neconomy need a global approach, as exemplified by \\npreparations for the United Nations Conference on \\nSustainable Development next year.  \\n One already evident consequence of climate \\nchange is an increase in the number of people who \\nneed clean water and food. Estonia will continue to \\nincrease its contribution to the United Nations \\nhumanitarian system. \\n While the world’s humanitarian needs grow, we \\nrequire increased coordination and strict scrutiny of the \\nreal needs of aid recipients. As donor Governments, we \\nare doubly accountable, first to those who require \\nassistance; but we are also accountable to our \\ntaxpayers for the effective use of every Euro cent. If \\nour taxpayers believe that Government is spending tax \\nmoney unwisely or ineffectively, they will vote for a \\nGovernment that cares less for foreign assistance \\nexpenditures. In these days of ever greater financial \\ndifficulty in donor countries themselves, this is not an \\nobservation to be ignored. \\n The many times I have addressed the General \\nAssembly, I have deliberated on the nature of the \\nUnited Nations and the need for reform. The United \\nNations needs to change as the world around us \\nchanges. System-wide coherence, delivering as one, \\nand revitalization of the General Assembly are steps in \\nthe right direction.  \\n We welcome these changes, yet at the same time \\nEstonia sincerely hopes that the same spirit will prevail \\nin reform of the Security Council. If nations are not \\ngiven a fair and equitable voice, proportional and \\nappropriate to its role in today’s world — not the world \\nof 1945 — we will find that the Organization has ever \\nless credibility. I propose that we adopt a new attitude \\nof openness to new developments in order to make sure \\nthat the United Nations as a whole can better deliver on \\nthe undoubtedly important issues for which it is \\nresponsible. \\n In conclusion, let me say that history did not end \\n20 years ago with the re-emergence of democratic \\nnations in Central and Eastern Europe. Nor will history \\nend with the Arab Spring. Democracy, freedom, human \\nrights, the rule of law and sustainable development all \\nrequire constant and consistent support and protection. \\n The world faces challenges, new and old. We face \\nthem daily. Today, as we commemorate the victims of \\nthe 9/11 terrorist attack ten years ago here in New \\nYork, we recognize how much the world has changed \\nsince the United Nations was founded 66 years ago. We \\nmust address and act upon these new challenges. It is \\nwe, the United Nations, who need to keep pace with \\nchanges and developments in the world we live in to \\nprotect and promote universal values across the globe.',\n",
       " 'Twenty years ago, \\nLithuania rejoined the international community of \\nsovereign States and became a Member of the United \\nNations. The unique experience of peaceful transition, \\nState-building and reforms during the past 20 years has \\nmade Lithuania stronger and more determined. History \\nhas taught us that an honest broker at the national, \\n  \\n \\n11-50871 16 \\n \\nbilateral or multilateral level is the key to solving \\nalmost any problem.  \\n In recent years, we have invested in building our \\ncapacity to become such a broker. Lithuania has just \\nconcluded its chairmanship of the Community of \\nDemocracies. Today, we are proud to chair the \\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. I \\nam also confident that Lithuania’s commitment to \\neffective multilateralism and the fostering of dialogue \\nand cooperation internationally makes it a deserving \\ncandidate for non-permanent membership of the \\nSecurity Council. We are ready and determined to run \\nfor a non-permanent seat in the Security Council for \\nthe 2014-15 term.  \\n Meanwhile, looking forward to Lithuania’s \\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh \\nsession next year, I would like to assure members that \\nwe will do our utmost to contribute effectively and \\nwisely to the work and principles of the United Nations \\nin all of its bodies. \\n Just a few months ago, women leaders from all \\nparts of the world met in Vilnius to share their \\nexperiences in enhancing democracy worldwide. This \\nevent, organized by Lithuania as Chair of the \\nCommunity of Democracies, confirmed my belief that \\nthe involvement of women in addressing common \\nproblems and concerns is still very low. Therefore, \\nLithuania strongly welcomed resolution 65/283 on \\nstrengthening the role of mediation in the peaceful \\nsettlement of disputes, conflict prevention and \\nresolution, proposed by Finland and Turkey and \\nadopted by the General Assembly. I am very pleased \\nthat that resolution advocates the enhanced role of \\nwomen in peace mediation. The full involvement of \\nwomen in conflict resolution, peace talks and decisions \\non post-conflict reconstruction is essential.  \\n The same applies to the protection of women in \\nconflict situations as defined in the historic Security \\nCouncil resolution 1325 (2000) and related resolutions. \\nI would like to announce that Lithuania has drawn up \\nits first national action plan for implementing \\nresolution 1325 (2000). \\n We live in an era of constant change. The \\nmaintenance and improvement of our ability to tackle \\ntraditional crises must be supplemented with an \\nincreased capacity of the United Nation to address such \\nnew threats and challenges as energy security, \\ncybercrime, food safety and climate change, to mention \\nonly a few. I especially appreciate and would like to \\nstress the importance of the Secretary-General’s strong \\nengagement in nuclear safety and his call to build a \\nstronger connection between nuclear safety and nuclear \\nsecurity.  \\n In the light of the world’s energy needs today, \\nnuclear energy can be an essential element of \\nsustainable global development, provided it is used \\nwith necessary responsibility. I would like to draw the \\nAssembly’s special attention to the word \\n“responsibility”. Chernobyl and Fukushima are tragic \\nexamples, but they teach us very important lessons. It \\nis not enough to rely only on recommendations, \\nproposals and encouragement for cooperation when we \\ndeal with nuclear safety issues. I believe that our \\nresponsibility is to create strict legal international \\nimperatives. We cannot allow any compromises on \\nsafety and security. \\n In this respect, the efforts of the United Nations, \\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the \\nEuropean Union and other organizations to ensure \\nnuclear safety throughout the world are critically \\nneeded today. Lithuania emphasizes the key role of the \\nIAEA in this area. We welcome the ambitious nuclear \\nsafety action plan that was adopted by the IAEA \\nGeneral Conference in Vienna today.  \\n Lithuania believes that strict adherence to \\nuniform nuclear safety standards must be obligatory. \\nSpecialized Agency missions for the entire nuclear \\ncycle, including site evaluation and follow-up \\nmissions, should also become an inseparable part of \\nany nuclear power plant development. Each and every \\nnuclear power plant, its site, nuclear technology and \\neven the ability of the personnel to ensure safety \\nmaintenance should be subject to stress tests. Last but \\nnot least, information about all existing and planned \\nnuclear projects must be absolutely transparent and \\nopen to public access. \\n We believe that the nuclear security summit in the \\nRepublic of Korea next year will provide an excellent \\nplatform for discussing nuclear safety and security \\nissues for the whole world. With a view to that \\nforthcoming summit, Lithuania is ready to contribute \\nto the practical measures set forth in the 2010 Nuclear \\nSecurity Summit Work Plan. \\n The prevention of any type of crisis — be it a \\nmilitary conflict, a nuclear accident or a terrorist \\nattack — is a challenge for all of us. But it is also an \\n \\n \\n17 11-50871 \\n \\nopportunity: an opportunity to strengthen the United \\nNations leadership, an opportunity to intensify our \\njoint work, an opportunity to promote dialogue and \\nmediation, and even an opportunity to save resources \\nthat can then be devoted to research and development, \\nprotection of the environment and support for the most \\nvulnerable. I invite us all to seize that opportunity for \\nthe sake of our common safety, security and prosperity, \\nwhich is what we all wish for.',\n",
       " 'In May I visited \\nTunisia, the cradle of the revolutions that have spread \\nacross the Arab world. I spoke to many people there \\nwho told me about their deep yearning for freedom, \\nabout the decades during which their freedom had been \\nsuppressed and about what the revolution meant for \\ntheir lives. One of them was Essma Ben Hamida, the \\nstrong-willed director of a civil society organization \\nactive in micro-finance. She said literally to me, “If \\n  \\n \\n11-51390 16 \\n \\ndemocracy would mean that I lose my rights as a \\nwoman, I do not want democracy.” In one sentence, \\nMs. Ben Hamida defined one of the key challenges we \\nface. \\n The call from the streets of the Arab world for \\nfreedom and democracy has brought about great \\nchange. It has inspired people around the world to \\nclaim their rights.  \\n But huge challenges remain. And the severe \\nfinancial and economic crisis is threatening growth and \\ntrade around the globe. This crisis is undermining \\npeople’s ability to earn a living and enjoy freedom to \\nthe fullest extent. It is thus crucial that we manage \\nthese developments.  \\n The United Nations and individual Governments \\nmust support people’s calls for freedom. Freedom is a \\nright for everyone, a duty for Governments and the \\nmission of the United Nations. Freedom must be \\nsupported by three key pillars: first, security; second, \\ndemocracy and the rule of law; and third, prosperity. \\n Lack of security is a fundamental threat to \\npeople’s freedom. Providing security is a responsibility \\nof Governments and of the international community as \\na whole. \\n In March this year, we rose to the challenge. \\nSecurity Council resolution 1973 (2011) on Libya was \\ntruly historic. It explicitly referred to the international \\ncommunity’s responsibility to protect. It highlighted \\nthe indispensable role of the United Nations. \\n By contrast, the Council’s failure to reach \\nconsensus on Syria has been at great human cost. \\nEvery day we are shocked by new, horrific stories. This \\nvery weekend peaceful demonstrators were carrying a \\nsign that read: “Help Syria. It is bleeding.” We need to \\nlisten to the people of Syria. We need to stop President \\nAl-Assad’s Government from brutally murdering his \\nown citizens in an attempt to crush their legitimate call \\nfor freedom. I urge all members of the Security \\nCouncil to act decisively and agree on targeted \\nsanctions against the regime. \\n Freedom and security are also key issues in the \\nMiddle East peace process. If we do want peace, we \\nneed direct negotiations now, not new resolutions at the \\nUnited Nations. The Netherlands endorses the time \\nframe outlined by the Quartet and stands ready to assist \\nwherever it can. We are a major donor to the \\nPalestinian Authority. We fully support the ambition of \\nthe Palestinian people to build a viable, democratic and \\npeaceful Palestinian State. However, this cannot be \\nviewed separately from the Israeli people’s desire to \\nlive in a secure, internationally recognized Jewish State \\nin peace with their neighbours.  \\n It is really essential that the two parties invest in \\nmutual confidence, refrain from unilateral steps and \\nfind a solution together. They should be prepared to \\nmake the difficult and painful concessions necessary \\nfor the fulfilment of their peoples’ aspirations. I talked \\nwith President Abbas. I talked with Prime Minister \\nNetanyahu. I listened carefully to what they had to say, \\nand the message is simple and clear: negotiate, \\nnegotiate, negotiate. \\n Democracy and the rule of law are the best \\nguarantees for freedom, but they require hard work. As \\nFrancis Fukuyama put it, democracy is more than the \\nmajority voting in elections. It is a complex set of \\ninstitutions that restrain and regularize the exercise of \\npower through law and a system of checks and \\nbalances. That is what it is about.  \\n I admire the tremendous courage that people, \\nyoung and old, have shown to claim their individual \\nliberty and democratic rights. We must support their \\nefforts to build truly democratic societies governed by \\nthe rule of law. The United Nations should play a \\nleading role by helping with institution-building and \\ndeveloping the rule of law. To that effect, Slovakia and \\nthe Netherlands, for their part, are co-chairing the \\nCommunity of Democracies’ task force that is \\nsupporting Tunisia’s democratic transition. \\n The international community should also support \\ninternet access that is free and uncensored. This is an \\nessential tool for people to exercise their freedom of \\nexpression, and we should take great care to make sure \\nthey can use it. Countries supporting this cause should \\nreally unite around it. \\n As Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon recently said, \\n“Countries do not become fit for democracy; they \\nbecome fit through democracy.”  \\n Democracy means freedom and equal rights for \\neveryone. It provides opportunities to empower \\nwomen. Women represent 50 per cent of the world’s \\nhuman capital. It is in every country’s own interest to \\nensure that women take an active role in society and \\n \\n \\n17 11-51390 \\n \\nthe economy as well as in the political process in the \\npolitical power structures. I am convinced that in free \\nand fair elections, extremists who want to take away \\nwomen’s rights will not succeed.  \\n Real democracy also means that the rights of \\nreligious groups, including Christians, are respected. \\nSociety as a whole should be tolerant towards those \\nwith other religions and beliefs. There should be no \\ndoubt about that. \\n Freedom offers the best route to prosperity. The \\nongoing global economic crisis is affecting prosperity \\neverywhere in our world. \\n Enabling free trade is vital to economic recovery. \\nMarket access is crucial for private sector \\ndevelopment. Breaking down the barriers to trade in \\nagricultural products can galvanize entrepreneurship in \\nthe countries that really need it the most. The Arab \\nregion in particular should benefit from enhanced \\nexport opportunities to the European Union.  \\n The beauty of well-regulated free trade is that it \\nis not a zero-sum game; it benefits everyone and it is \\npart and parcel of freedom. This is why the World \\nTrade Organization (WTO) Doha Round must succeed. \\nThe world should not and cannot revert to \\nprotectionism. The WTO has an important part to play \\nin preventing this. The European Union is also \\nambitiously negotiating free trade agreements with \\nvarious partners. Of course, these agreements should fit \\nwithin the multilateral system. \\n Free trade leads to economic growth, which in \\nturn should also benefit the poorest countries in this \\nworld. To further support their growth, we should \\nenhance their access to education, vocational training \\nand microfinance for women and the poor. \\n Freedom belongs to us all. Those who have \\nfought to gain their freedom will never give it up. \\nFreedom must be supported through security, \\ndemocracy and the rule of law, and prosperity. We can \\nachieve this through the efforts of Member States. \\nSince the United Nations is the international forum \\nwhere global issues and actors come together, it is here \\nat the United Nations that we must join forces. We are \\nwitnessing international developments unfolding more \\nrapidly than ever before. The United Nations needs to \\nadapt to maintain its important role in international \\nrelations. \\n For that matter, the Security Council should \\nbetter reflect changing international relations and \\neconomic realities. The Netherlands supports a modest \\nenlargement of the Security Council, but with a limit \\non the right of veto in order not to undermine the \\neffectiveness of the Council’s decision-making process. \\n The Netherlands supports the Secretary-General’s \\ndrive for budgetary discipline. We have to make careful \\nchoices about what to finance and what not to. I also \\nurge emerging economies to take their share of \\nresponsibility for the sustainability of United Nations \\nfunding. \\n The United Nations has an essential role in \\nfostering the rule of law around the world, as well as in \\npreventative diplomacy and mediation. The Netherlands \\nwill play its part, including through the role of The \\nHague as the international city of peace and justice. \\nThe Peace Palace, the international courts and the legal \\ninstitutions attest to our long tradition of international \\nlaw and active role in its practice. That tradition, may I \\nsay, goes back to Grotius’s early seventeenth-century \\nMare Liberum, which laid the foundation for \\ninternational law. \\n I would like to congratulate Secretary-General \\nBan Ki-moon on his reappointment. I call on him to \\nuse the overwhelming support for his second term as a \\nmandate to reform the United Nations. A strong and \\nactive United Nations is essential in a world in which \\nno country can shape the future single-handedly. To \\nsucceed, public support for the United Nations is \\ncrucial. Clear and tangible results are necessary to \\nsustain the commitment of Governments to the United \\nNations. An effective and efficient United Nations is in \\nthe national interests of all its Member States, and is, \\nindeed, essential for freedom throughout the world. \\n Through our efforts at the United Nations, we can \\nsupport the calls for freedom around the world. Then, \\non my next visit to Tunisia, Essma Ben Hamida, a \\nstrong-willed woman, can hopefully tell me that \\nfreedom has brought her both democracy and her rights \\nand empowerment as a woman.',\n",
       " 'It is a distinct \\nhonour and pleasure for me to address the General \\nAssembly at the outset of its sixty-sixth session. This \\nforum provides us with an unparalleled opportunity to \\nstrengthen, through dialogue, our concerted efforts in \\nthe quest for solutions to the mounting challenges that \\nthe international community faces today. We, the \\nleaders of the United Nations, are expected to offer \\nguidance and find solutions. \\n I am convinced that, given the extensive \\ndiplomatic experience of the President of the \\nAssembly, and under his able leadership, we will be \\nable to make this session a successful one. I wish him \\nevery success in his demanding duties and assure him \\nof my delegation’s full support and assistance. I also \\nwish to express my delegation’s appreciation and \\ngratitude for the exquisite work of his predecessor, \\nMr. Joseph Deiss, who so skilfully guided our \\nproceedings during the sixty-fifth session. \\n Let me also join others in paying tribute to the \\nremarkable work of the newly reappointed Secretary-\\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon. We deeply \\nvalue his eminent personal and diplomatic qualities and \\nlook forward to working with him during his next \\ntenure. \\n Slovakia warmly welcomes the Republic of South \\nSudan as a new member of the United Nations family. \\nWe wish South Sudan every success and, above all, \\npeace, security and prosperity for its people. \\n Her Excellency Ms. Dilma Rousseff, President of \\nthe Federative Republic of Brazil, opened her speech \\nwith these words:  \\n  “For the very first time in the history of the \\nUnited Nations, a female voice is opening the \\ngeneral debate. It is the voice of democracy and \\nequality.” ()  \\nPresident Rousseff expressed in two words the main \\nchallenge for the coming years: courage and sincerity. \\nThis challenge is accurate at a time of economic and \\ndebt crisis. We have to say openly that we still do not \\nhave adequate solutions. We are facing common risks \\nin economy, governance and politics. \\n Citizens all over the world expect leadership and \\na mutual synergy of economy and politics. The \\nmajority of the world’s population expects economic \\ngrowth, prosperity and a better quality of life. Those \\nliving in poverty — the millions of people without \\njobs, without water and without food — expect real \\nanswers, quick action and results from political \\nleaders. \\n What can such a small country as Slovakia do to \\naddress these challenges? First, it has to do its own \\nhomework in stabilizing the economy. That means \\nensuring our pension system’s sustainability through \\ndeep reforms, and enacting a fiscal responsibility law \\nthat will ensure that fiscal policy is responsible to \\nfuture generations and counter-cyclical. It means \\nlabour market reforms that support the creation of the \\nnew jobs the country badly needs, especially for some \\nof its vulnerable groups. It means lowering the \\nadministrative burden and decreasing barriers to \\nentrepreneurship, improving the predictability of the \\nlegal environment, and ensuring a wider use of \\ne-Government services. Of course, it means measures \\nto tackle corruption and to increase transparency, for \\nexample through a legal act ensuring that any contract \\nconcerning the use of public funds is valid only if \\npublished on the internet. \\n  \\n \\n11-51360 8 \\n \\n The Slovak Republic is a small country, but it is a \\npart of the eurozone, which is in deep economic \\ntrouble. Courage and sincerity are most needed most \\nthese days in Europe. The financial crisis and its \\nnegative influence upon the entire European banking \\nsector have clearly shown that the eurozone was not \\nprepared for a crisis. The chaos in addressing these \\nissues only deepened the general distrust and worsened \\nthe subsequent economic recession. The majority of \\nEuropean Union countries did not use the good \\neconomic times to consolidate their budgets. Therefore, \\nin many cases, the consequences of the recession \\nshifted public debt into dangerous territory. \\n We need courage in the eurozone to return to the \\nold principles that established the European Union, \\nwhich are necessary for successful international \\ncooperation and integration. We need stricter European \\nand national fiscal rules. We need to institute default \\ncontrols, and we need new rules for the careful \\nmanagement of the financial sector. \\n We need sincerity. We have to be honest with our \\ncitizens, because we have to be very careful that the \\nresponse to forcing technical solutions to the debt \\ncrisis is not the escalation of nationalism and populism. \\nThere is a chance that we will save the eurozone \\neconomically, but at the same time we must minimize \\nthe risk of losing the project of European integration \\npolitically and devaluing it in the eyes of our voters. \\n It is not just Europe; every region in the world is \\nstruggling today with serious economic difficulties. We \\nlive in a global, interdependent reality in which we \\ncannot afford to ignore anybody’s problems. In this \\nregard, we believe that, as a member of the Economic \\nand Social Council, that body has the capacity to \\ncontribute more significantly to our joint efforts. If it is \\nto do that, we feel that it is urgent to adjust its mandate \\nand enhance its ability to react more swiftly to the \\neconomic and social needs of the world. \\n In times of dire financial restrictions in our own \\nnational budgets, we, as the United Nations, also need \\nto learn to do more with fewer resources. We welcome \\nevery effort that the Secretary-General is making to \\nutilize the available resources with maximum \\neffectiveness and efficiency. \\n Peace and security are ever harder to maintain in \\nthese harsh crisis times. One of Slovakia’s priorities in \\nthe fight against international terrorism remains the \\nendeavour to move forward the negotiations on the \\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism. \\nWith regard to the United Nations Global Counter-\\nTerrorism Strategy, Slovakia will continue its \\nimplementation through concrete projects, as we have \\nby co-organizing a special event on implementing the \\nUnited Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy in \\nCentral Asia, held in Bratislava in December 2010. \\nRespect for international law, human rights and the rule \\nof law should be an integral part of the fight against \\ninternational terrorism. \\n Peacekeeping missions are among the most \\nvisible and successful activities of the United Nations \\nand the true expression of the commitment to \\nmaintaining peace and security around the globe. The \\nSlovak Republic has been an active contributor to the \\nUnited Nations forces in Cyprus since 2001, and is \\ninvolved in the Middle East. In recent decades, we \\nhave witnessed an unprecedented proliferation of \\nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions. They have \\nbecome increasingly in-demand, their mandates are \\nwidening and their management is becoming more \\ncomplex. Slovakia therefore supports every measure \\naimed at increasing their effectiveness and efficiency \\ngiven our truly constrained budgets. \\n Peace is not merely the absence of war. Peace \\nmeans safety in all areas of people’s lives, economic \\nprosperity, social stability, respect for human rights and \\nfundamental freedoms, access to health care and \\neducation, protection of the environment, and access to \\nwater and food. There is no chance of lasting peace \\nwithout sustainable development. That is an area in \\nwhich we must still do a great deal of work and make \\nconcerted efforts. Aid from Slovakia — a small \\ncountry — has since 2003 been aimed at the most \\ntroubled regions of the world. Recently, Slovakia has \\nbeen providing development and humanitarian aid in \\nthe context of 41 projects to help starving children in \\nKenya, deliver food and water in Ethiopia; provide \\nhumanitarian help in South Sudan; assist Pakistan \\nfollowing the terrible floods there; help refugees, from \\nLibya to Tunisia; and also to provide technical \\nassistance for countries in the western Balkans and in \\nthe Middle East. Slovakia is also helping to secure the \\ndemocratization process in Afghanistan through 13 \\nnew projects. \\n We need to focus on eliminating the primary \\ncauses of conflicts, not just deal hastily with their \\ngrave consequences, which, sadly, often occur only \\nafter too many lives have been destroyed. No effort \\n \\n \\n9 11-51360 \\n \\nshould be spared in exploring all political and \\ndiplomatic options to stop conflicts at their roots. \\nMediation has proved to yield tangible results. I want \\nto stress the important role of women in these \\nprocesses, as it is often underestimated.  \\n Slovakia is a firm supporter of effective \\nmultilateralism, with the United Nations playing a \\ncentral role. Concentrated efforts help create just and \\nlasting solutions. \\n This will be yet another challenging session for \\nall of us. It calls for a renewed, shared commitment to \\nthe fundamental principles and purposes of the United \\nNations Charter. We cannot afford to lose the ability to \\nunderstand one another’s needs because of our own \\ndomestic problems. In these hard times, I wish all of us \\nenough strength to find necessary, mutually \\nadvantageous solutions.',\n",
       " '\\ufeffIt is an honour once again\\nto address the United Nations. This year I would\\nlike to focus on responsibility. The recent years of\\neconomic and financial turbulence have demonstrated\\na strong correlation between economic prudence and\\nresponsibility in fiscal matters. We have realized, I\\nhope, that sustainability is not a term we apply only\\nto development, but concerns all of us. Responsibility\\nand sustainability apply to the three broad topics I shall\\naddress today: human rights, good governance and\\ndevelopment. But before doing so, I would like to speak\\nabout diplomacy.\\nThe purpose of diplomacy is to prevent war.\\nWhen diplomats are attacked we are all less secure.\\nWe know what we are talking about — we too have\\nhad our diplomats attacked, mercifully without the\\nhorrific consequences that occured in Benghazi.\\nTherefore, the recent assaults in many parts of the\\nworld on diplomats, embassies and consular premises are deplorable. Regardless of their motivations, such\\nacts are unjustifiable and must be universally and\\nunequivocably condemned. All countries must fulfil\\ntheir international legal obligation to protect diplomatic\\nand consular properties and personnel.\\nAs recent events have demonstrated, when it\\ncomes to human rights it is not enough merely to keep\\nyour own house in order. As a conscientious member\\nof the international community, Estonia feels the\\nresponsibility to do more globally. That includes paying\\nattention to human rights violations in places torn by\\nconflict, as well as doing more to stop and prevent the\\nviolation of the rights of women and the child. It also\\nmeans making the most of new technologies in the\\nservice of fundamental rights and freedoms. The need\\nto take responsibility and do more is also why Estonia\\nlooks forward to becoming a member of the Human\\nRights Council and to working proactively towards the\\nfulfilment of its mandate.\\nPermit me to touch upon the developments in\\nSyria. We have witnessed the complete breakdown of\\nany semblance of the rule of law. We continue to see\\nextensive human rights and international humanitarian\\nlaw abuses. It appears that both sides have committed\\nserious international crimes. Yet we still see no solution.\\nWe cannot look on and wait for the violence to spread\\neven more widely. The Security Council — especially\\nits permanent members — must overcome their\\ndifferences and find a solution to the bloodshed. The\\nleast that all parties must do is to allow for humanitarian\\naid to be safely delivered and to guarantee the security\\nof humanitarian workers. Without an end to the armed\\nconflict, without peace, there can be no political\\nprocess.\\nBut it is not only Syria that needs our attention.\\nWe should not avoid the problem of protracted conflicts\\nthat have already waited for years to be solved. We\\nshall speak with one voice against continuing violations\\nof the territorial integrity of sovereign States and for\\nthe secure return of all forcefully displaced persons.\\nMoreover, more attention to conflict prevention would\\nhelp to avoid such violations in the future.\\nA stronger commitment to conflict prevention and\\nto the enhancement of the rule of law can help to avoid\\nviolent conflicts and the most heinous international\\ncrimes. Under the principle of the responsibility to\\nprotect, States committed in 2005 to protect their\\npeople from ethnic cleansing, genocide, war crimes\\nand crimes against humanity. Today the content of the responsibility to protect is not debated. The difficulty,\\nhowever, lies with its application: when Governments\\ndo not live up to their responsibility, the international\\ncommunity must react and act.\\nThe international criminal justice system,\\nespecially the International Criminal Court, plays a\\ncrucial role in providing timely and decisive responses\\nto such crimes. Investigations by the Court may deter\\nfurther atrocities, prevent their escalation or accelerate\\ntheir end. It is therefore essential to cooperate with the\\nCourt and apprehend those it has indicted.\\nAs a result of the evolving nature of military\\nconflicts, civilian casualties tragically are on the\\nrise. Among civilians, women and children are the\\nmost vulnerable. When we take that into account,\\nSecurity Council resolution 1325 (2000), on women,\\npeace and security, takes on a whole new immediacy.\\nFurthermore, conflict-related sexual violence requires\\nmore attention. Such violence can easily lead to further\\nwar crimes and crimes against humanity. Moreover,\\nin advancing the rights of the child, the International\\nCriminal Court’s recent decision to convict Thomas\\nLubanga Dyilo was a significant achievement and will,\\nwe hope, have a strong deterrent effect in the future to\\nprevent crimes against children.\\nThe Crimean War, in the 1850s, brought the world\\nthe first extensive photographic reports of conflicts.\\nToday, new media make it even more difficult to hide\\nwar crimes both on and off the battlefield. Modern\\ntechnology brings home the reality and horror of war.\\nWe must therefore recognize the important role of\\ntechnology in advancing human rights.\\nFreedom of expression is a human right, whether in\\nthe city square, the press or in cyberspace. For the third\\nyear in a row, Freedom House has ranked Estonia first\\nin the world in Internet freedom. We have joined the\\ncoalition Freedom Online, a group of States working\\nclosely together to advance human rights online. In\\naddition, Estonia looks forward to discussing actively\\nmatters relating to Internet freedom in the Human\\nRights Council, which adopted a resolution on that\\ntopic this year (resolution 20/8). The resolution was a\\ngenuine milestone affirming that fundamental rights\\nin the virtual world must be protected with the same\\ncommitment as in the real world.\\nInternationally, there are worrisome developments\\nrelated to Internet governance. Too many countries\\nspeak about the dangers of a free Internet from a security perspective. The truth is, as we know well,\\nthat cybersecurity is needed to prevent oppressive\\nGovernments and criminals from wreaking havoc. It is\\nnot to prevent peaceful individuals from speaking their\\nminds or gathering information and exchanging ideas.\\nDespite having experienced extensive cyber attacks\\nduring the so-called Web War One, five years ago, Estonia\\ndoes not support more rigid regulation and censorship\\nin cyberspace. Estonia is committed to an open, secure\\nand reliable Internet. It is therefore imperative to ensure\\nthat the International Telecommunication Union’s new\\nregulation does not lead to the restriction of Internet\\nfreedom and unnecessary limits to the free f low of ideas\\nand information. In fighting cybercrimes, the Budapest\\nConvention on Cybercrime provides the appropriate\\nand primary legal framework at the global level.\\nGlobally, there is a deficit of good and responsible\\ngovernance. Its lack is the root cause of countless\\nother ills. But again, some progress has been made.\\nI was proud to represent Estonia when I signed on\\nto the Open Government Partnership, along with\\nrepresentatives of 42 other countries. That multilateral\\ninitiative aims to take concrete steps to institute a new\\nmodel of governance to maximize the potential of new\\ntechnologies and, most important, to tackle corruption.\\nThe information revolution we experience these\\ndays has assisted Estonia to successfully and rapidly\\ntransform itself into a rule-of-law-based democratic\\nsociety. Estonia was the first country where people\\ncould cast their vote online in parliamentary and\\nmunicipal elections. Just a few months ago we\\nconducted our census for the first time to a large extent\\nonline. This year more than 90 per cent of taxpayers in\\nEstonia filed annual income tax returns via the Internet.\\nE-government, e-school, e-medical prescriptions\\nand e-parking are examples of Estonian innovation\\nin the field of citizen-friendly public services. They\\nincrease transparency and help to prevent and cut\\ndown corruption. They reduce costs. Most importantly,\\nhowever, they have increased the possibility to exercise\\nfundamental rights and freedoms and improve inclusive\\nand responsible governance. Therefore, Estonia wishes\\nto share its e-governance skills and to continue to\\nfacilitate exchanges with partners worldwide.\\nMy comments on the need to do more apply to the\\nUnited Nations too. Without reform, its global mission\\nwill be unsustainable. We need change, ranging from\\nreforming the United Nations in the broadest sense to\\ncutting the waste of paper. In an information age it is increasingly necessary to distinguish noise from signal,\\nto distinguish genuine data from spin.\\nI have spoken thus far about what Governments\\ncan and must do. In our increasingly interconnected,\\nwired and wireless world, civil society and the private\\nsector play an ever-greater role. Governments benefit\\nfrom involving non-governmental organizations,\\nentrepreneurs and private individuals in governance.\\nEstonia and many other countries increasingly and\\nsuccessfully do so. The challenge, however, is for the\\nUnited Nations system — a multilateral organization\\nbased on modern, post-Westphalian States — to embrace\\nthose other actors and to involve them in finding\\nsolutions and decision-making.\\nAllow me to continue by sharing some thoughts\\nrelated to development and responsibility.\\nSustainable development is not a clichéd utopia;\\nnor is it something forced on us from above. True\\ndevelopment can be nothing other than sustainable. Yet\\nwe have seen unsustainability masked as development,\\ndespite the contradiction in terms.\\nConsider the global financial crisis. Burdening our\\nchildren and grandchildren with mountains of debt is\\nimmoral, as is living at the expense of others. Growth\\nwithout responsibility is illusory. We have learned that\\nthe hard way. Let us not make the same mistake again.\\nWe are another year closer to the deadline we set\\nourselves for achieving the Millennium Development\\nGoals (MDGs). Were they too ambitious? I do not think\\nso. Aiming high is the least we can do. There is no point\\nin setting targets that we can be confident of achieving\\neffortlessly. Yet we must resist the temptation to sell\\neverything as a success if that is not the case. Failure to\\nachieve all the MDGs is no excuse not to set new targets.\\nThe world needs sustainable development goals. We are\\nstill in a preliminary phase of the discussion. Let us aim\\nhigh and do our best.\\nDespite the world’s best efforts, millions\\nremain in poverty. The information technology (IT)\\ntransformation will create massive opportunities all\\nover the world. We must, however, avoid a digital\\ndivide that would stymie this historic chance to\\naccelerate development in all parts of the world. I was a\\nmember of Kofi Annan’s high-level panel of experts on\\ninformation and communication technology — already\\na decade ago — and I continue to be concerned about\\nthe gap between the digital haves and have-nots,\\nespecially because, by investing in IT, countries such as mine have leapt into modernity and transparency. New\\ninformation and communications technologies have the\\npotential to trigger the next industrial revolution, but\\ngovernments cannot achieve it alone.\\nEntrepreneurs expanding the range of global\\nknowledge networks are key partners in fighting\\npoverty and creating a more transparent economy.\\nThey can also make an outsized difference in their\\ncommunities and the world. However, Governments\\nmust provide a secure and fruitful environment for\\nthose sorts of ideas to emerge and prosper. Twentyone\\nyears after restoring our independence, Estonia is\\nan example where a combination of responsible free\\nenterprise, e-governance, international partnerships\\nand eco-friendly policies can put a country in the fast\\nlane of development.\\nExperience shows that if we fail to act responsibly,\\nwe will, in the end, be forced to do so. Let us begin by\\nacting responsibly.',\n",
       " '\\ufeffAllow\\nme at the outset to express my sincere congratulations\\nto Mr. Vuk Jeremić on his assumption of the presidency\\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session. I\\nhave every confidence that under his able leadership\\nthis session will be crowned with great success.\\nHumankind continues to advance, drawing on our\\ncollective wisdom to address challenges throughout\\nhuman history. Although new global challenges to\\nmankind such as climate change, poverty and disease,\\nunderdevelopment, terrorism and proliferation of\\nweapons of mass destruction are now testing the\\ninternational community, I have no doubt that we will\\novercome those challenges on our future path.\\nThe United Nations, the symbol of our collective\\nwisdom, should take greater responsibility in coping\\nwith the challenges. I note with great satisfaction that\\nthe United Nations is becoming a more accountable and\\ntrusted international Organization under the prominent\\nleadership of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. In that\\nregard, I recognize and support the Secretary-General’s\\nfive-year Action Agenda, which I believe will guide\\nus in addressing current world challenges and onward\\ntowards the future we are aiming for.\\nThe United Nations Conference on Sustainable\\nDevelopment (Rio+20), held in June in Rio de Janeiro,\\nrepresented a critical step forward towards ushering in the world we hope for. The outcome document, entitled\\n“The future we want” (resolution 66/288, annex),\\nmarks a substantial advancement for sustainable\\ndevelopment. The task before us now is to capitalize on\\nour achievements thus far and exert even greater effort\\non follow-up actions such as developing sustainable\\ndevelopment goals, strengthening the institutional\\nframework and mobilizing finance.\\nAs part of such endeavours, the Republic of Korea\\nestablished the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI).\\nSixteen countries signed the agreement to establish the\\nGGGI on the margins of the Rio+20 meeting, and the\\nInstitute will be launched as an international organization\\nstarting in October. The GGGI will engage in a range of\\nactivities for disseminating the green growth paradigm,\\nin which the economy and the environment form a\\nvirtuous cycle. Moreover, the Korean Government is\\nprepared to step up its contribution to international\\nefforts to achieve a sustainable future by hosting the\\nsecretariat of the Green Climate Fund. The Republic of\\nKorea stands ready to render wholehearted support for\\nthe successful launch and stable operation of the Fund.\\nThe Republic of Korea is keen on contributing\\nto the balanced and harmonious development of the\\ninternational community and is fully cooperating\\nin such efforts in the context of the United Nations.\\nThe Korean Government continues to increase its\\nofficial development assistance to help achieve the\\ninternationally agreed development goals, including\\nthe Millennium Development Goals. The Republic of\\nKorea underscored the importance of inclusive growth\\nand development partnership at the 2010 Seoul Summit\\nof the Group of Twenty and the Fourth High-level\\nForum on Aid Effectiveness, held in Busan in 2011. In\\nJune, the Global Partnership for Effective Development\\nCooperation was launched for the implementation of the\\nBusan commitments. The Busan Forum and the launch\\nof the Global Partnership will mark a turning point for\\ninternational development cooperation by broadening\\nour perspective from aid effectiveness to development\\neffectiveness.\\nOur own experience has taught us that investment\\nin education is at the heart of effective development.\\nIn that vein, we are confident that the Education First\\ninitiative of the Secretary-General will, indeed, provide\\na solid foundation for achieving the international\\ndevelopment goals. The Korean Government extends\\nits strong support for the initiative. The Republic of Korea is also taking an active part\\nin the discussions on shaping the post-2015 development\\nframework. We fully recognize the importance of a\\ncomprehensive approach that takes into account the\\neconomic, social and environmental dimensions of\\nsustainable development.\\nThe aspiration for human rights, fundamental\\nfreedoms and democratic values is the primary driving\\nforce for the advancement of humanity. Today, many\\ncountries have been striving to advocate human rights\\nin tandem with democracy. The United Nations, as the\\nepicentre of the international community’s efforts to\\npromote and protect human rights, has provided timely\\nassistance to such countries.\\nRecently, we witnessed the strong desire of people\\nin the Middle East and North Africa to realize their\\naspirations for democracy and respect for human\\nrights. The recent positive developments in Myanmar\\nare also well worth noting in that regard. However,\\nwhile those changes are still unfolding, enormous\\nchallenges and difficulties still lie ahead. In Syria, a\\ngreat number of civilians have been killed and gross\\nviolations of human rights have been witnessed. With\\nhigh hopes towards the efforts of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi,\\nthe Joint Special Representative of the United Nations\\nand the League of Arab States for Syria, the Korean\\nGovernment will stand by the Syrian people through\\nthis time of suffering together with the international\\ncommunity.\\nThe Korean Government expresses deep concern\\nat the recent attacks against diplomats and diplomatic\\nmissions in several places. Such violence cannot be\\njustified regardless of the motivation.\\nPutting an end to sexual violence against women\\nin armed conflict is another issue that warrants serious\\nattention. Wartime sexual violence is a fundamental\\ninfringement of human rights and is, in fact, an affront to\\nhuman dignity and integrity. History has left important\\nlessons that warn against such egregious acts.\\nThe Republic of Korea would like to urge the\\nUnited Nations system and all Member States to do\\ntheir utmost to put an end to such atrocities, not only\\nby taking all measures to protect women and girls in\\narmed conflict, but also by providing effective remedies\\nand reparations for victims and ending impunity by\\nbringing the offenders to justice in accordance with the\\nrelevant resolutions of the United Nations. Both a sound historical consciousness and a\\nheartfelt soul-searching into any past wrongdoings are\\nrequired in order to establish solid peace and stability\\nbetween nations. A country’s true valour is proven when\\nit confronts the dark side of its history and endeavours\\nto rectify past wrongdoings.\\nIt is the firm conviction of the Korean Government\\nthat respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty\\nas enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations,\\nshould be the guiding principle for stable international\\nrelations.\\nNo country should abuse international legal\\nprocedures or the concept of the rule of law in order to\\ninfringe upon the territorial integrity and sovereignty\\nof other countries or distort historical justice.\\nThe Republic of Korea is actively contributing\\nto the global efforts being undertaken in pursuit of a\\nworld without nuclear weapons. The Seoul Nuclear\\nSecurity Summit held last March brought together\\nleaders from across the world to galvanize the vision\\nand the determination of the international community\\nto achieve a peaceful world without nuclear terrorism.\\nDuring the Summit, the Korean Government played a\\nleading role in forging a consensus to take important\\npractical steps, such as the substantial reduction of\\nnuclear materials, the promotion of the universality of\\ninternational conventions and cooperation to combat\\nillicit trafficking of nuclear materials. I am delighted\\nthat the High-level Meeting on Countering Nuclear\\nTerrorism, which was convened this morning, has\\nprovided new momentum to further energize the efforts\\nseen at the Seoul Summit for the prevention of nuclear\\nand radiological terrorism.\\nFurthermore, existing and emerging threats\\nin cyberspace, such as rampant transnational\\ncybercrime and potential cyber conflicts, present\\na serious challenge. It is therefore imperative that\\nthe international community address those threats.\\nBy hosting the 2013 Conference on Cyberspace, the\\nRepublic of Korea hopes to contribute in multiple ways\\nto the ongoing global efforts to maximize the benefits\\nof digital networks. We further believe that the event\\nwill provide an unparalleled opportunity to pool our\\nefforts to cope with threats stemming from the misuse\\nof information and communication technologies.\\nThe North Korean nuclear programme continues\\nto pose a threat, not only to the security of the\\nKorean peninsula and North-East Asia, but indeed to the very basis of the international non-proliferation\\nregime. As long as the Democratic People’s Republic\\nof Korea continues to pursue its nuclear and missile\\nprogrammes, achieving the goal of sustainable peace\\non the Korean peninsula and in the region will remain\\nfar off. Unfortunately, the international community’s\\naspirations were shattered once again when the\\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea launched a\\nlong-range missile in April 2012. In response to that\\nprovocative action, the Security Council reaffirmed\\nthat the international community will not tolerate the\\ncontinued pursuit by the Democratic People’s Republic\\nof Korea of its nuclear and missile programmes by\\nissuing a firm and resolute presidential statement in an\\nunprecedentedly swift manner (S/PRST/2012/13).\\nWe urge with concern that the Democratic People’s\\nRepublic of Korea should take concrete measures aimed\\nat denuclearization, which will also open an avenue to\\nimproving the livelihood of its people. At the same\\ntime, we sincerely hope that the Democratic People’s\\nRepublic of Korea will listen to the international\\ncommunity’s call for the improvement of that country’s\\nhuman rights situation, as repeatedly affirmed in the\\nrelevant United Nations resolutions.\\nAs a country that has risen from the ashes of war,\\nwe have learned the values of peace and security. In\\nthat context, we earnestly hope to have the opportunity\\nto promote such values by serving as a non-permanent\\nmember of the Security Council for the 2013-2014 term.\\nThe Republic of Korea is determined to fulfil that role\\nwith the greatest enthusiasm and devotion. We hope\\nthat States Members of the United Nations understand\\nand support our bid for membership in the Council.\\nWe are united by the ideals set out in the United\\nNations Charter. In pursuit of international peace\\nand security, the continued promotion of social and\\neconomic development and the promotion of human\\nrights, we should embrace a spirit of cooperation and\\ntolerance, with the United Nations at the centre of\\ninternational efforts to that end. The Republic of Korea\\nwill persist in fully playing its part in the invaluable\\nwork of the United Nations, taking on the various\\nchallenges that humanity will continue to confront.',\n",
       " 'It was \\nin my country, in Ypres, during the First World War, \\nthat chemical weapons were used in a conflict for the \\nfirst time. We can all recall the dreadful suffering of \\nthousands of those soldiers. Almost 100 years later, \\nthat same suffering is being inflicted on thousands of \\nSyrians. Despite the international Geneva Protocol of \\n1925, the history of the world — a shared history — is \\nrepeated, from Ypres to Damascus.\\n\\nThis is the second year that I have addressed the \\nGeneral Assembly from this rostrum. In one year, so \\nmany hopes have been raised and fulfilled but, at the \\nsame time, so many additional war crimes have been \\ncommitted. A year ago, I spoke of 30,000 Syrian \\ndeaths. Today there are 120,000. And that conflict is \\nnot the only one. While we are talking here, atrocities \\ncontinue in various parts of the world.\\n\\nAll of us here must show as much courage as the \\nmen and women who are fighting in the streets for their \\nfreedom and dignity. Within the United Nations, we \\nhave everything we need to act, while those who are \\nfighting often have nothing but their courage to live on. \\nIf a veto must be cast, it should be a veto on tyrants and \\ntheir crimes.\\n\\nNo one can end a famine or stop a tyrant alone.\\nPeace is a shared responsibility. That is why there is \\nno alternative to multilateralism and politics, if we \\nseek to improve the lot of humankind. That is what \\nmotivates Belgium’s commitment, which is political, \\nfinancial and at times even military, as the fifteenth \\nmost significant contributor to the United Nations.\\n\\nMy country is also of the view that among \\nour responsibilities we have the responsibility to \\nprotect — that is to say, the responsibility to prevent and \\nfight the particularly atrocious crimes of genocide, war \\ncrimes, crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing. \\nBelgium fully supports the actions of the United \\nNations in that regard. In 2014, we will organize an \\ninternational conference in Brussels on the prevention \\nof genocide.\\n\\nWhen we work together, we achieve results. Mali is \\nproof of that. But let us not forget that nothing is ever \\n\\nsettled forever. For it to last, peace must be continuously \\nnourished. I would like to commend in particular the \\nrecent efforts of the international community in the \\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. The population \\nof the north-east of the country has for years suffered \\nmassacres, mass rapes, the forced recruitment of \\nsoldiers, including of child soldiers, pillage and forced \\ndisplacement. Just yesterday, witnesses told me of \\nmartyred children. That is shameful.\\n\\nThe efforts of the Secretary-General and the \\nSecurity Council to strengthen the mandate of the \\nUnited Nations Organization Stabilization Mission \\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo are bearing \\nfruit. The Intervention Brigade is playing an active \\nrole in protecting the population. The Addis Ababa \\nFramework offers a genuine possibility for the \\nstabilization of the entire region. However, let us make \\nno mistake: agreement at Kampala is essential for the \\nprocess to be successful. Pragmatic solutions must \\nalso be found — without, however, accepting general \\namnesty or allowing for impunity for war crimes and \\ncrimes against humanity.\\n\\nBelgium stands ready to contribute to such solutions. \\nThe territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic \\nof the Congo must also be respected. All external \\ninterference must cease. Belgium urges the Congolese \\nauthorities to implement the structural reforms needed \\nin the army and the police, so as to re-establish the \\nrule of law throughout the national territory and to \\nguarantee the prosperity of the Congolese people.\\n\\nGoing to war, building walls and curtailing rights \\nis always easier than building bridges and keeping \\nthe peace. It is easier to build walls than to organize \\na democratic system or build hospitals and schools. \\nIn our contemporary globalized world, conflicts can \\nbe resolved only by political solutions. That is why \\nBelgium supports the efforts of Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, \\nJoint Special Representative of the United Nations \\nand the League of Arab States, as he seeks to bring \\nthe parties to the negotiating table. In that regard, I \\nwelcome the American-Russian initiative to hold the \\n“Geneva II” conference.\\n\\nIt is not death that metes out justice; it is respect \\nfor the law. It is the law that organizes human societies, \\nprotects the weak and prevents violence. Law is \\nessential because a world without rules — whether in \\nterms of civil interactions, trade or finance — leaves \\nhumankind face to face with its worst enemy: itself. \\nRespect for the law is a foundation of the life we share. \\nLaws must be respected, including in situations of \\nconflict. I am referring in particular to humanitarian \\nlaw, so that victims can receive assistance and care.\\n\\nBelgium has echoed and tirelessly backed the calls \\nfrom humanitarian agencies for the obstacles to their \\nactivities to be lifted. We demand that access to health \\ncare be improved on the ground everywhere, including \\nin Syria. All parties must respect international \\nhumanitarian law. My country participates actively \\nin efforts to provide assistance to populations that \\nhave been victims of fighting. The onset of winter \\nand the sharp rise in the number of victims, refugees \\nand displaced persons mean that the international \\ncommunity must step up its efforts further still.\\n\\nThe law must also stop impunity. Peace cannot ever \\nbe built on amnesty for the worst crimes, or turning a \\nblind eye thereto. Together with 56 other States, Belgium \\nhas called for the situation in Syria to be referred to the \\nInternational Criminal Court. The work of the Court is \\ncontributing to bringing about an era of responsibility. \\nAll States should cooperate with the Court.\\n\\nThe law must also make it possible to bring \\ndictatorships and oppression to an end. In 2010, all \\nthose who defend democracy welcomed the advent of \\nthe Arab Spring. I am not one of those who today have \\nturned their backs on that hope. Let us not forgot all \\nof the women and men in Tunisia, Libya, Egypt and \\nelsewhere who wish to live in peace. We must support \\nthem and promote the holding of free elections. We \\nshould encourage them to draft constitutions that \\nguarantee fundamental rights, justice and equality. We \\nshould also recall that winning an election or exercising \\nauthority following elections does not give someone \\nthe right to oppress minorities. True democracy means \\nrespecting and protecting minorities.\\n\\nThe law must guarantee individual freedoms. \\nFreedom means, for example, the right of young women \\nto study and to choose their partners for themselves \\nor to remain single. Freedom also means the rights \\nof women to move in public as they please. Freedom \\nalso means to right to practice one’s religion or to \\npractice none at all. Freedom also means the right of \\nheterosexual and homosexual couples to walk hand in \\nhand in the street or in other public spaces. I am proud \\nthat Belgium guarantees those fundamental freedoms. \\nI am also proud that my country promotes efforts to \\nspread such freedoms everywhere in the world.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nWhile I am speaking of continuing our efforts \\nand making them lasting, I would like to mention the \\nresumption of the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. It is \\nabsolutely vital that we seize the opportunity afforded \\nby our American friends. A solution must be arrived at \\nnow, based on the coexistence of two States, with the \\nState of Israel and an independent State of Palestine \\nliving side by side in peace and security. We have also \\nmade it very clear that we are against colonization. \\nIn that context, Belgium is ready to host a conference \\nin Brussels aimed at ensuring that private economic \\npartners provide support for the peace process. We \\nbelieve that there can be no economic plan, however, \\nunless there is a political plan with a concrete timetable.\\n\\nPeace and security also depend on harmonious \\nprosperity, whose benefits must be shared equitably \\naround the globe and among its citizens. According to \\nscientists, the world’s ecological footprint now exceeds \\nthe world’s capacity for regeneration by about 50 per \\ncent. That situation is untenable and affects everything \\non the planet. \\n\\nI welcome the United Nations initiative to convene \\nHeads of State and Government here in New York for \\na forum on sustainable development. It is here that \\nless developed and developed countries can solve the \\nhuge challenge of sustainable development together. \\nEvery country has problems that are either shared or \\ncomplementary and interconnected. By that I mean \\nextreme poverty, desertification, the exodus for \\necological reasons of millions of people, the exhaustion \\nof natural resources and climatic warming.\\n\\nDespite the progress that has been made, \\nmuch remains to be done to meet the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals. Hunger, poverty and unequal \\naccess to education and health care are intolerable \\ninjustices. We must continue to mobilize to fight them. \\nThat is why Belgium asks that the efforts made under \\nthe rubric of post-2015 development be merged with the \\ngoals of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \\nDevelopment in a single negotiation framework within \\nthe United Nations. That single framework should \\nbring together the economic, social and environmental \\naspects that are becoming facts of life for all of us.\\n\\nI would like to touch on one final subject, that is, \\nespionage and cybercrime. Our colleague President \\nDilma Rousseff asked a true question for today (see \\nA/68/PV.5). Is it permissible to ignore privacy laws in \\nthe name of security and the fight against terrorism, \\ntwo areas that are basic for all peoples? I support \\nthe call by the President of Brazil for protecting the \\nprivate lives of citizens everywhere, in particular \\non the Internet. She proposed the establishment of a \\nmultilateral framework designed to effectively ensure \\nthe protection of data online. The Internet must not \\nbecome an invisible battleground. It should remain an \\ninstrument of freedom and development for all, a place \\nwhere all can communicate in peace and security.\\n\\nIn 2014, along with other nations, Belgium will \\nsolemnly commemorate the centenary of the First \\nWorld War. We will do it out of duty to the memory \\nof the young men from more than 50 countries who \\ncame to die on the battlefields of my country in order \\nto liberate us. They were not even 20 years old. We will \\nalso commemorate the war’s centenary in order to teach \\nyoung people of today, so that they too can become \\nmilitants for peace.\\n',\n",
       " 'Exactly \\n40 years ago, the two German States joined the United \\nNations. For Germans, that marked our full return to the \\ncommunity of nations. Germany supports the United \\nNations as the beating heart of a global order rooted \\nin cooperation, peaceful compromise and cooperative \\nsolutions.\\n\\nThe world has changed dramatically since then. \\nNew centres of economic and political power are \\nemerging. In recent years, Germany has established \\nnew strategic partnerships with the new global players \\nin Asia, Latin America and Africa.\\n\\nThe setting of our meeting today is different \\nfrom the usual one. The United Nations is undergoing \\nrenovation, which must not be restricted merely to the \\nbuildings. The United Nations must reflect the world \\nas it is, not as it used to be. Only then will it be fit for \\nthe challenges of our age. A Security Council without \\npermanent seats for Africa and Latin America does \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nnot reflect the realities of today’s world. A Council in \\nwhich the emerging and highly populous region of Asia \\nis represented by only one permanent seat does not \\nreflect the realities of today’s world. Nor does it reflect \\nthe reality of tomorrow. Germany, with its partners \\nJapan, India and Brazil, is prepared to assume greater \\nresponsibility. In essence, it is a matter of strengthening \\nthe United Nations. The authority of the United Nations \\ndepends on its being representative.\\n\\n\\nWe are seeking reform of the United Nations so that \\nits power to build consensus, establish global rules and \\nact effectively in response to crises and conflicts can \\nbe demonstrably strengthened. This is a call not only \\nto the United Nations itself, but also to each and every \\nindividual Member State. Only if we are prepared to \\ncompromise and are willing to act together will we \\nbe able to make the United Nations strong. Germany \\nremains committed to the United Nations. A strong \\nUnited Nations is in Germany’s interests.\\n\\nOur cultural differences and diverse traditions are \\nnot going to vanish in the age of globalization, but it \\nis not only the world’s markets that are becoming ever \\nmore closely interconnected: people’s expectations, \\nhopes and ideas are globalizing too. The developments \\nin the Arab world have shown us that a country’s \\nstability depends primarily not on the stability of \\nthe Government but on social stability. The best \\nguarantees for a society’s internal cohesion are respect \\nfor individual human rights, the triumph of the rule \\nof law over the arbitrary, and broad economic, social \\nand political participation on the part of the people. \\nGermany is committed to democratic change and to \\nrespect for human and civil rights, not because we want \\nto take the moral high ground but because we have \\nlearned from experience — from the painful experience \\nof our own history.\\n\\nIn Syria the people took to the streets to protest \\nagainst a repressive regime. For more than two years \\nnow, the regime’s response has been brutal violence, \\nwhich has brought countless deaths, immeasurable \\nsuffering and terrible destruction on the Syrian \\npeople and is now jeopardizing stability in the entire \\nregion. The use of chemical weapons, ascertained by \\nthe United Nations, is a crime against civilization. Its \\nterrible dimensions have consequences that extend far \\nbeyond Syria. All the facts available to us show that the \\nregime is responsible for the use of chemical weapons.\\n\\nThe use of chemical weapons cannot be allowed to \\ngo unpunished. That we owe not only to the victims in \\nSyria, but also to future generations. Those responsible \\nfor using such weapons must be called to account \\nbefore the International Criminal Court, which must at \\nlast be able to begin its independent investigations. We \\nwelcome the agreement reached in the Security Council \\nyesterday. The chemical weapons in Syria must be \\ncompletely destroyed in accordance with a firmly \\nagreed timetable. Germany is prepared to provide \\nfinancial and technical help to destroy those chemical \\nweapons. A world without weapons of mass destruction \\nwould be a better world.\\n\\nWe must take advantage of the opportunity for a \\npolitical process offered by the agreement on destroying \\nthe chemical weapons. After all, people in Syria are \\nstill being killed every day by conventional weapons. \\nBut there will be no military solution in Syria. Only a \\npolitical solution can bring lasting peace to Syria. That \\nwould include an immediate ceasefire. I am pleased \\nthat there is at last a timetable for a possible peace \\nconference, details of which still have to be clarified \\neven after yesterday’s decision in the Security Council. \\nOnly with a substantive political process can we counter \\nthe destabilization of the entire region.\\n\\nTo date, Germany has made available more than \\n€420 million to ease the worst of the suffering of the \\nSyrian people. But despite all of the outside help, \\nmillions of Syrians are fleeing. Ever more people are \\nat acute risk of starvation, and very soon they will also \\nbe at the mercy of the cold weather. They do not have \\neven the most basic medical care. We must seize every \\nopportunity to provide humanitarian access to the \\nsuffering population as quickly as possible. Amid all \\nthe devastation and hatred, the United Nations and its \\nstaff are the face of compassion and, for many Syrians, \\nthe only hope. I would like expressly to pay tribute to \\ntheir work and commitment.\\n\\nThe tragedy in Syria underlines the extraordinary \\nand growing importance attached to disarmament \\naimed at eliminating weapons of mass destruction and \\nthe strengthening of the non-proliferation regimes. \\nAttaining a world free of weapons of mass destruction is \\nour generation’s prime task for the future. Disarmament \\nis a crucial issue for the future of humankind.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nIran must allay the international community’s \\ndoubts about the exclusively peaceful nature of its \\nnuclear programme. We welcome Iran’s announcement \\nthis week that it is prepared to do so. The talks with the \\nIranian Government were encouraging. They open up \\na window of opportunity. Now it is imperative that we \\nrebuild trust. Germany is ready to conduct negotiations \\nin a constructive manner. However, the new words \\ncoming out of Tehran must be followed by deeds, and \\nnot at some unspecified time in the future, but right \\nnow. But, I repeat: a fresh start has been made.\\n\\nWe welcome the great commitment shown by \\nPresident Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry \\nin giving fresh impetus to the negotiations between \\nIsrael and the Palestinian leadership. Prime Minister \\nNetanyahu and President Abbas deserve our respect \\nfor their courage in embarking together on that course. \\nThey have our full support as they pursue that course \\ntowards a negotiated agreement. Only a negotiated two-\\nState solution can reconcile the legitimate interests of \\nthe two sides.\\n\\nThis week in New York has been an encouraging \\none for the world. I am gratified that it was not military \\nsolutions but the struggle for political and diplomatic \\nsolutions that came to the fore. The international \\ncommunity must continue to follow such an approach.\\n\\nBeyond crisis diplomacy, the United Nations is \\nthe central forum for setting binding objectives for \\nthe international community. Just a few days ago, the \\nGeneral Assembly agreed on the next steps for drawing \\nup a new post-2015 sustainable development agenda. \\nGermany wants to make a contribution in that regard \\nwith its experience of combining economic prosperity \\nand promoting political participation and sustainable \\nmanagement.\\n\\nSustainability and combating poverty are not only \\nkey social issues; they are also key foreign policy issues.\\n\\nIn formulating the future agenda, greater attention \\nneeds to be paid to human rights protection and good \\ngovernance than has been the case in the past. The \\nnew agenda must incorporate all three dimensions of \\nsustainability and take account of economic, social and \\nenvironmental aspects. With such a comprehensive \\napproach we can also strengthen the fragile statehood \\nin many countries and eradicate safe havens for \\nterrorists. Social stability is the best protection against \\nradicalization and extremism.\\n\\nGerman foreign policy is a policy for peace. It \\nfocuses on crisis prevention. We Germans accept our \\nresponsibility for international peacekeeping. We \\nfocus on personal and social development. We focus on \\nstrengthening civil society. We want to contribute to \\na global process in which we — in the North, South, \\nEast and West learn from each other and develop joint \\nsolutions by working together. Germany will continue \\nin future to use its economic clout and full political \\nstrength to promote peace and the balancing of interests.\\n\\nThe digital age brings with it entirely new \\nopportunities and challenges. We need an Internet in \\nwhich freedom, security and the protection of privacy \\nare appropriately reconciled. Just as we have to regulate \\ninternational financial flows in order to prevent global \\ncrises, so we need binding rules and standards for \\nglobal data flows. That is why Germany has submitted \\nto the Human Rights Council an initiative regarding \\nthe protection of the right to privacy in the digital \\nage. Everyone using the Internet should be able to be \\nsure that their rights are being respected worldwide \\nvis-à-vis private companies as well as vis-à-vis States. \\nNot everything that is technically possible must be \\nallowed to happen, nor is everything technically \\npossible legitimate.\\n\\nGermany remains firmly anchored in Europe. \\nEurope is a community of shared cultures, bound \\ntogether by a common destiny. Close union among \\nthe nations of Europe is and will remain the response \\nto our history and to our future in a world of change. \\nGerman foreign policy is firmly embedded in European \\nforeign policy. Europe will continue to use its clout, \\nits influence and its resources to uphold peace and \\njustice, to encourage development and cooperation \\nand to promote climate protection and disarmament \\nthroughout the world.\\n\\nThat is Germany’s twin obligation: a strong united \\nEurope in the world and a strong, effective United \\nNations for the world.\\n',\n",
       " 'The central theme of the sixty-\\neighth session of the General Assembly is sustainable \\ndevelopment. With its three main pillars this constitutes \\na comprehensive agenda, even more comprehensive with \\nall of its prerequisites: conflict prevention, bringing \\npeace and security to war-torn countries and bringing \\nperpetrators to justice through the implementation \\nof international law. Helping the weakest to help \\nthemselves, shaping economies that pay focused \\nattention to social-agenda and environmental issues \\nand that effectively use e-technologies, protecting \\nhuman rights and supporting the rule of law and \\ndemocracy — these are all integral parts of sustainable \\ndevelopment.\\n\\nThe report of the High-level Panel of Eminent \\nPersons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda notes \\nthat Governments bear the primary responsibility for \\nassuring sustainable development and for improving the \\nlives of people in their territories. Sustainability can be \\ntruly implemented, however, only if we instil it in the \\ncore thinking of Governments, societies, individuals \\nand the international community as a whole.\\n\\nLet me start with what is clearly and without a \\ndoubt the most unsustainable situation in the world at \\nthe moment: the conflict in Syria. It has been repeated \\nthousands and thousands of times, and must continue to \\nbe repeated over and over again, that the use of chemical \\nweapons is unacceptable under any circumstances \\nand requires complete and unreserved condemnation. \\nIt is clear that chemical weapons must be destroyed \\nquickly and verifiably. Therefore the Organisation for \\nthe Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the Security \\nCouncil must — and I emphasize must — move forward \\nand agree on the legally binding terms to resolve that \\nissue, preferably under Chapter VII of the Charter, as \\nsoon as possible.\\n\\nEven without the use of chemical weapons, the \\nmilitary actions and brutality which have occurred in \\nSyria have created suffering and a humanitarian disaster \\nof unimaginable proportions. More than 110,000 \\npeople have been killed, and millions of refugees and \\ninternally displaced persons are scattered around the \\n\\n\\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the interpretation of \\nspeeches delivered in the other languages.

Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nregion. About 7 million Syrians are in urgent need of \\nassistance.\\n\\nWhile there is no quick or easy fix to that complex \\nsituation, we must keep doing what we can to ease \\nhuman suffering. Estonia is one of many countries that \\nhave been focusing on helping those who have been \\nforced to flee from their homes and protecting the most \\nvulnerable members of society: women and children. I \\nwould also like to praise the good work of UNICEF, the \\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the \\nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs \\nand humanitarian workers in Syria who often by risking \\ntheir own lives, have been able to organize and deliver \\nassistance.\\n\\nEvidence collected by the Human Rights Council’s \\nIndependent International Commission of Inquiry \\nindicates that war crimes, crimes against humanity and \\ngross human rights violations have been systematically \\ncommitted in Syria. Estonia is among the countries \\nthat joined the Swiss initiative in January, asking the \\nSecurity Council to refer the situation in Syria to the \\nInternational Criminal Court. It is the responsibility of \\nthe international community to protect, if a Government \\nfails to do so.\\n\\nIn contrast, let me turn to a country and conflict \\nwhere hope has been restored recently. That presidential \\nelections in Mali were carried out in a peaceful and \\ntransparent manner has paved the way for optimism. \\nThe newly elected President has many important tasks \\nahead, beginning with reconciliation between the \\nsouthern and northern parts of Mali. I wish Mr. Keita all \\nthe luck and energy he will need to rebuild his country, \\nand I can assure him that Estonia stands among the \\ncountries that will continue to help if needed.\\n\\nI venture to say that another country whose \\nfuture looks promising is Afghanistan. I believe that \\nresponsibility and ownership make people masters \\nof their own fate, and I can see the willingness of \\nAfghans to avail themselves of that opportunity. The \\ninternational community must continue to assist that \\ncountry in order to ensure that their efforts will bear \\nfruit. As a long-term partner of Afghanistan, Estonia \\nremains committed to assisting with the training and \\nfinancing of Afghan security forces after 2014, while \\ncontinuing to support educational progress, women’s \\nempowerment, the rule of law and health care.\\n\\nIt is also sadly true that conflicts can at times \\nbe alarmingly sustainable. For years, Estonia has \\nemphasized that protracted conflicts around Nagorno \\nKarabakh and in Georgia and Moldova must not fall \\noff the radar screen of the international community. \\nWithout the will of all the involved parties, no lasting \\nsolutions can be found.\\n\\nEvery year, over half a million people die as a result \\nof illegal or irresponsible arms transfers. Enormous \\namounts of money and resources are spent on arms, \\noften at the expense of far more vital needs. We view \\nthe adoption in June of the Arms Trade Treaty, within \\nthe framework of the United Nations, as a historic \\nmilestone for the world community.\\n\\nAs a responsible member of the international \\ncommunity, Estonia strongly supports and contributes \\nto the activities of the International Criminal Court \\nand the ad hoc tribunals established by the Security \\nCouncil. We continue to call for more States to ratify \\nthe Rome Statute and the amendments to the Rome \\nStatute relating to the crime of aggression. Universality \\nis key to ensuring that the perpetrators of the worst \\ncrimes of concern to the international community are \\nheld accountable. Accountability and the prevention \\nof atrocities have been the priorities of Estonia as a \\ncurrent member of the Human Rights Council. In the \\nCouncil, we also focus on the rights of women and \\nchildren and on their disproportionate suffering during \\narmed conflict.\\n\\nThe post-2015 sustainable development agenda \\nshould transform the Millennium Development Goals \\n(MDGs) into Sustainable Development Goals. In the \\nmeantime, we have learned that the MDGs should \\nhave focused more on reaching the poorest and most-\\nexcluded groups in society. The main challenge of the \\npost-2015 negotiations will be to formulate and reach \\nglobal agreement on one concrete and measurable \\nset of development goals that would keep the three \\ndimensions of sustainability in its core and maintain a \\nstrong focus on poverty eradication. The targets should \\nleave no one behind and be applicable and achievable \\nin every country.\\n\\nIn many societies, women and girls are the main \\ndrivers of development. Not allowing them to fulfil their \\npotential through education, decent job opportunities \\nand essential health services is to disregard the \\npotential of one half of humankind. It is also important \\nto remember that persons with disabilities have been \\none of the most excluded segments of our societies, \\nalthough they often have serious difficulties with access \\nto basic social services and decent job opportunities.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nOfficial development assistance will continue to \\nplay an important role in the sustainable development \\nof many countries in the future, but it cannot compete \\nwith the flow of international private investment nor \\nwith domestically mobilized resources. Therefore, \\nsynergies between different sources of finance, \\nbetter policies and strong national ownership are \\nnecessary. Nonetheless, the main drivers of sustainable \\ndevelopment are inclusive and responsible economic \\npolicies. A key enabler of growth is the bold use of \\nmodern integrated circuit technology solutions. They \\npromote better governance, access to public services, \\njob creation, transparency, accountability and civil \\nsociety participation.\\n\\nThat brings me to two issues of worldwide \\nimportance: cybersecurity and Internet freedom. The \\ntwo are intrinsically linked and in no way incompatible. \\nMoreover, they will require a multi-stakeholder model \\nof Internet governance. Freedom of opinion and \\nexpression, online or offline, is a cornerstone of every \\ndemocracy and constitutes a fundamental human right. \\nLast year, the Human Rights Council affirmed that very \\nsame principle. I am glad that the United Nations Group \\nof Governmental Experts on Cyber Issues affirmed that \\ninternational law is essential in promoting an open, \\nsecure and accessible cyberspace.\\n\\nIn our fight against cybercrime, it is essential to raise \\nawareness and to work on prevention by everyone, from \\nprivate computer users to large critical infrastructure \\nand cloud providers. Raising the awareness of political \\nleaders and national governments is equally important; \\ncybercrime may have serious consequences for national \\nsecurity as well as national wealth. Yet the Council of \\nEurope’s 2001 European Cybercrime Treaty — renamed \\nthe Convention on Cybercrime because participants are \\nfrom all over the world, and also known as the Budapest \\nConvention — remains thus far the only legally binding \\ninternational instrument that addresses cybercrime. \\nNeedless to say, the more countries accede to it, the \\nmore functional it will become. We find it odd that \\nthose countries with the largest sources of cybercrime \\nhave not acceded to the Convention, while in other \\nareas they stress the primacy of international law.\\n\\nThe United Nations has had and will continue to \\nhave a leading role in making the world sustainable. Yet \\nGovernments can do and must do their own fair share. \\nEstonia, for example, proudly continues to support the \\ninitiatives of civil society in contributing to sustainable \\ndevelopment. Approximately one half of the world’s \\ncountries have joined our 2008 initiative “Let’s Do It!” \\nto make people’s environments cleaner and our planet \\nenvironmentally happier.\\n\\nLet us remain alert and tuned in to every single \\ndetail that prevents us from advancing our common \\nwell-being, be it in developed or in developing countries. \\nLet us be united in that common effort.\\n',\n",
       " 'First, I would like to \\ncongratulate you, Sir, on assuming the presidency of \\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session.\\n\\nI would now like to make a new pledge about \\nthe situation in Syria. The use of chemical weapons \\nhas caused profound shock and anger on the part \\nof the people of Japan, including myself. Chemical \\nweapons must never be used again. I hereby declare \\nthat Japan will provide thorough support to, and the \\ngreatest possible cooperation with, the international \\ncommunity’s efforts to dispose of Syria’s chemical \\nweapons. We feel righteous indignation about innocent \\ncivilians continuing to be victims. Japan regards the \\ncessation of violence, the initiation of political dialogue \\nand the improvement of the appalling humanitarian \\nconditions as issues of the utmost urgency. \\n\\nAt this very moment, the number of refugees \\nis soaring. To them, Japan will provide still greater \\nassistance. We will act in cooperation with the \\ninternational community to extend a helping hand \\nto internally displaced persons and refugees fleeing \\nacross national borders. I take pride in the fact that \\nJapan’s non-governmental organizations and volunteer \\norganizations are working around the clock to help \\nthem.\\n\\nJapan will also continue to provide assistance to \\nareas under the control of the opposition groups, where \\nit is difficult for assistance from the international \\ncommunity to reach. We are working to undertake the \\ntraining of staff working at medical centres. We will \\nalso deliver portable X-ray devices and other medical \\nequipment to those areas.\\n\\nWith the escalating despair of refugees now as \\nthey head for a harsh winter, I would like to announce \\nthat the Government of Japan will provide and make \\nimmediately available approximately $60 million in \\nadditional humanitarian assistance to Syria and its \\nsurrounding countries. We are determined to conduct \\nsuch assistance in parallel with the process of political \\ndialogue, notably the “Geneva II” conference, and to \\nmove forward in cooperation with the international \\ncommunity.\\n\\nOur nation, Japan, and its capital, Tokyo, have \\nbeen granted the honour of hosting the 2020 Olympic \\nand Paralympic Games, seven years from now. To \\nreciprocate that good fortune we have come to enjoy, my \\nobligation first of all is to rebuild the Japanese economy \\nto be vibrant, and then to make Japan a dependable \\nforce that works for good in the world. I pledge here \\nthat I will make Japan a force for peace and stability \\nin the world, just as it has been until now — or, rather, \\nmake it an even greater such force than it has been thus \\nfar, given the increasingly tragic state of the globe.\\n\\nJapan will newly bear the flag of proactive \\ncontributor to peace, anchored in the undeniable record \\nof and the solid appreciation for our country, which has \\nendeavoured to bring peace and prosperity to the world \\nwhile emphasizing cooperation with the international \\ncommunity.\\n\\nThe balance of power in the world has been \\nchanging rapidly, and technological innovations are \\nnow removing all borders from both new opportunities \\nand new types of threats. It is now impossible for any \\none country, no matter which one it may be, to safeguard \\nits own peace and security acting entirely by itself. \\nThat is why Japan is working to garner trust from the \\nworld as a creator of added value and a net contributor \\nto regional and global peace and stability. Under those \\ncircumstances, the role of the United Nations will \\nbecome even more important than it is today. \\n\\nJapan has continually promoted the concept of \\nhuman security, and the implications of the concept will \\nsurely expand. Through the accumulated discussions \\nover the nine years since the submission of a report \\nby the Commission on Human Security, the resolution \\non a common understanding on the notion of human \\nsecurity was adopted, here at the General Assembly, \\nin September 2012 (resolution 66/290). Guided by the \\nwisdom of its forerunners, Japan is determined to \\nfurther spread the concept and build actual practices.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nI will enable Japan, as a proactive contributor to \\npeace, to be even more actively engaged in United \\nNations collective security measures, including \\npeacekeeping operations. I believe that Japan must \\ncontinually cultivate our human resources so that they \\nare appropriate for use in United Nations activities.\\n\\nFor Japan, whose national interests are firmly \\nconnected to the stability of open seas, changes to the \\nmaritime order through the use of force or coercion \\ncannot be condoned under any circumstances. Japan \\nhas great expectations that public spaces, ranging \\nfrom outer space and cyberspace to the skies and the \\nseas, will be rigorously preserved as global commons \\ngoverned by rules and laws.\\n\\nJapan, as a country that understands the horror and \\ndevastation wrought by atomic bombs, will utterly devote \\nitself to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation and \\nthe total elimination of nuclear weapons. North Korea’s \\nnuclear and missile development cannot be condoned. \\nJapan also maintains serious concerns with respect to \\nother weapons of mass destruction that North Korea is \\nlikely to possess. Pyongyang should listen to the unified \\nvoice of the international community and rectify its \\nown actions by taking a tangible step. We demand that \\nNorth Korea return every Japanese national whom it \\nhas abducted, without exception. While in office, I \\nam determined to resolve that issue completely. The \\nnormalization of diplomatic relations with North Korea \\nremains unthinkable without the resolution of that \\nissue.\\n\\nAs for the nuclear issue of Iran, Japan hopes that \\nthe country’s new Administration will move forward \\nwith concrete actions. We are ready to continue to play \\na role in resolving the issue.\\n\\nIn the Middle East region, a cornerstone for world \\npeace and prosperity, Japan will continue its unique \\ncontributions towards the Middle East peace process.\\n\\nJapan will also continue to extend cooperation to \\nthe countries of Africa, which are certain to become a \\ngrowth engine in the twenty-first century. Firmly rooted \\nin our own experiences, that cooperation takes the \\nfostering of human resources as its main emphasis and \\nseeks to achieve sustainable growth while cultivating \\nownership by Africa itself. In June, my Government \\ninvited African Heads of State and Government and \\nrepresentatives of international organizations to \\nJapan, where it convened the fifth Tokyo International \\nConference on African Development (TICAD V). On \\nthat occasion, I was deeply struck by the eagerness \\nexpressed by representatives of African nations for \\nprivate sector investment. \\n\\nInvestment flow to Africa now exceeds the flow \\nof assistance. I also heard from the African leaders \\ntime and again that assistance should be utilized \\nstrategically as a catalyst for attracting investment. \\nThat is the evolution that discussions in the 20-year-\\nlong TICAD process have witnessed and given rise to. \\nTICAD V became a forum where we celebrated the \\npath that Africa has walked down, and together we \\nreconfirmed that Japan has been an enduring partner \\nweaving dreams side by side with Africa.\\n\\nI hold the firm conviction that the future course \\nof Japan’s diplomacy will begin here, by sparing \\nno pains — and with our regained strength and \\ncapacity — to become actively engaged in meeting the \\nhistoric challenges that today’s world faces. I consider \\n“sparing no pains” to be nothing less than the basso \\ncontinuo notes that set the basic tone for Japan’s actions, \\nbe they in diplomacy or any other field.\\n\\nAs a country with such intentions, strengths and \\nachievements, Japan considers it extremely regrettable \\nthat the structure of the Security Council is still frozen \\nin a state that reflects the realities of some 70 years ago. \\nSecurity Council reform must proceed without delay. \\nJapan’s aspirations to becoming a permanent member \\nof the Council have not changed in the slightest.\\n\\nEverything begins with Japan refortifying its true \\nabilities and its economy. The growth of Japan will \\nbenefit the world. Japan’s decline would be a loss for \\npeople everywhere. How, then, does Japan aim to \\nrealize its growth? Mobilizing the power of women will \\nserve as both a source and outcome of growth, a point \\nalmost self-evident at this gathering.\\n\\nThere is a theory called “womenomics”, which \\nasserts that the more the advancement of women \\nin society is promoted, the more growth increases. \\nCreating an environment in which women find it \\ncomfortable to work and enhancing opportunities for \\nwomen to work and to be active in society is no longer \\na matter of choice for Japan. It is instead a matter of the \\ngreatest urgency.\\n\\nHaving declared my intention to create a society \\nin which women shine, I have been working to change \\nJapan’s domestic structures. However, that is not \\nconfined merely to domestic matters. I would now \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nlike to discuss how it is also an issue guiding Japan’s \\ndiplomacy. To begin with, I would like to state four \\ncontributions through which Japan aspires to remain a \\nleading member within the international community. \\n\\nFirst, Japan respects the activities of UN-Women \\nand intends to become one of its leading contributors, \\nand therefore an exemplary country in that area. Japan \\nwill also work closely with the relevant international \\norganizations.\\n\\nSecondly, as other like-minded countries have \\nalready done, Japan also intends to develop a national \\naction plan with regard to women, peace and security, \\nin cooperation with people working at the grass-roots \\nlevel. \\n\\nThirdly, Japan will cooperate closely with not \\nonly UN-Women, but also the International Criminal \\nCourt and the Office of the Special Representative of \\nthe Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, \\nMs. Zainab Hawa Bangura. It is an outrage that there \\ncontinues to be sexual violence against women during \\ntimes of armed conflict even now, in the twenty-first \\ncentury. Japan will do everything possible to prevent \\nsuch crimes against women and to support — both \\nmaterially and psychologically — those people who \\nunfortunately become victims of such acts.\\n\\nFourthly, Japan will submit once more at the next \\nsession of the Commission on the Status of Women \\na draft resolution that gives careful consideration to \\nwomen in natural disasters, as they are likely to be \\nvulnerable. Japan, which experienced a major natural \\ndisaster two years ago, wishes to garner support for \\nthe draft resolution, which embodies our outpouring of \\nsupport for the matter.\\n\\nI would now like to make use of the examples \\nof three individuals to clarify Japan’s development \\nconcept aimed at bringing about a society in which \\nwomen shine, and also to shed light on some issues that \\nmust be tackled. I will first introduce the examples of \\na Japanese woman and a Bangladeshi woman, and then \\nthat of an Afghan woman, as the third example.\\n\\nMs. Tokiko Sato was an expert at the Japan \\nInternational Cooperation Agency, responsible for \\nimproving maternal, newborn and child health for \\nover 15 years in a remote village in Jordan. Undaunted \\nby the suspicious looks she initially received from \\nthe villagers, Ms. Sato would speak with anyone, \\nanywhere. Devoted to her ideas, including making \\nuse of public entertainment to persuade the villagers, \\nMs. Sato finally found herself accepted by the village \\ncommunity. Ms. Sato’s tenacity gradually transformed \\nthe traditional idea that the one who decides the number \\nof children is the husband, not the wife, into a mindset \\nthat values the health of women.\\n\\nAs the Assembly is aware, my country played \\na leading role in the establishment of the the Global \\nFund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Japan \\nintends to continue to make an appropriate contribution \\nat the upcoming Fourth Replenishment, which seeks to \\nsecure additional financing for the Fund. However, as \\nfor the post-2015 development agenda, it would be most \\nappropriate to broaden the focus to encompass those \\ndiseases individually. \\n\\nJapan regards approaches that address individuals \\nholistically as better able to meet their broader health \\nneeds. That is why Japan decided to promote universal \\nhealth coverage — “UHC — on the occasion of TICAD \\nV. To address health issues in the African region, \\nwe have readied $500 million and are at present \\nconcentrating on setting up training for 120,000 health \\nand medical services providers. With regard to medical \\ncare for all, there can be no doubt that the people who \\ngive the human touch to the three letters in “UHC” are, \\nin concrete terms, people like Ms. Sato, who without \\nhesitation go into local communities. \\n\\nThe second person I would like to introduce is \\nMs. Nilufa Yeasmin, a young Bangladeshi woman and \\nthe mother of two. Her professional title is “Poly-Glu \\nLady”. Poly-Glu is a made-in-Japan water purifier \\nderived from a food that can be found in Japan in great \\nabundance. One simply adds it to turbid water. Poly-Glu \\nacts as an adsorbent, adhering to excess substances in \\nthe water, and then falls to the bottom as a precipitate, \\nleaving the water clear. It is necessary to teach people \\nhow to use it correctly at the outset, and Ms. Yeasmin \\nand other Poly-Glu ladies serve as both salespersons \\nand instructors.\\n\\nAs members can see, as with what is called a “base of \\nthe pyramid” business, that endeavour is characterized \\nby the expectations placed on the power of women. By \\ncombining her income with her husband’s, Ms. Yeasmin \\nhas been able to send her children to an institution of \\nhigher education. Poverty caused her to give up on the \\ndream she had cherished as a little girl of becoming a \\ndoctor someday. But I understand that now she proudly \\nstates she has become a doctor of clean water. Can we \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nnot say that Ms. Yeasmin has acquired self-esteem, the \\nmost precious asset of all? My Government wishes to \\ncreate as many Ms. Nilufa Yeasmins as possible. \\n\\nBy the way, the company that makes Poly-Glu is a \\nvery small Japanese company. We will work to enhance \\nthe assistance to such companies and organizations to \\nallow their ideas to bear fruit.\\n\\nFinally, there is one more woman I would like to \\nintroduce to everyone in the Hall today, but this Afghan \\nlady is no longer with us. Her name is Ms. Islam Bibi, \\nand on 4 July she was gunned down and assassinated. \\nShe was 37 years old and is survived by three children. \\nMs. Islam Bibi was a proud female police officer \\nwith the Afghan police. She came to shoulder heavy \\nresponsibilities through her nine years of service. She \\nguarded polling stations to monitor elections and was a \\ntrainer to young female officers coming after her. We \\nhave much work to be done. However, we must proceed \\nundaunted.\\n\\nUnder the auspices of the Law and Order Trust Fund \\nfor Afghanistan, Japan has been one of the countries that \\nhave always taken great pains to improve the capacity \\nof the Afghan police force and cultivate female police \\nofficers, whose number will finally reach 1,800 — still \\nfar from enough. I have renewed my determination to \\ncontinue to provide support in order to prevent another \\ncase like that of Islam Bibi.\\n\\nI wanted to emphasize — through the real-life \\nexample of Ms. Nilufa Yeasmin in Bangladesh — the \\nnecessity of promoting women’s participation in society \\nand their empowerment. My Government has prioritized \\nthat as its foremost policy and will continue to undertake \\nhighly inventive efforts, including launching start-up \\nbusinesses in Africa.\\n\\nThrough her actions, Ms. Tokiko Sato, the \\nJapanese aid specialist, has highlighted the importance \\nof maternal, newborn and child health, an MDG \\nwhose attainment has been conspicuously slow. My \\nAdministration will, as its second priority policy area, \\nengage greater efforts towards women’s health and \\nmedical care.\\n\\nFinally, what I hoped to convey through the tragic \\nexample of Islam Bibi is the importance of women’s \\nparticipation and their protection in the context \\nof peace and security. Japan intends to promote \\nmeasures to ensure women’s participation at all \\nstages — including in conflict prevention and resolution \\nand in peacebuilding — and to safeguard their rights \\nand the physical well-being of women who are exposed \\nto danger in times of conflict.\\n\\nI would like to state here that in establishing those \\nthree pillars, the Government of Japan will direct \\nofficial development assistance in excess of $3 billion \\nover the next three years, to target the pillars.\\n\\nIn conclusion, if we were to follow the wisdom \\nof the so-called “womenomics” theory, as mentioned \\nearlier, the development concept aimed at cultivating \\nthe power of women would generate greater peace and \\nwell-being in the world. I wish to bring about a society \\nwhere women shine, within Japan and in conflict \\nregions and countries suffering from poverty. In that \\ncontext, I do not consider the outlook to be optimistic. \\nHowever, I know one thing: in Japan a considerable \\nnumber of people are working unsparingly towards that \\nend. They are the people who are making every effort to \\nready themselves to be able to work together, in unity.\\n',\n",
       " 'May I first \\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of \\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I am \\nconfident that the current session will be a fruitful one \\nunder your able leadership.\\n\\nThe Republic of Korea is pleased that the United \\nNations, in partnership with its Member States \\nand under the stewardship of Secretary-General \\nBan Ki-moon, is strengthening multilateralism by \\nsuccessfully responding to the diverse challenges that \\nthe international community faces. We are confident \\nthat the Secretary-General’s Five-Year Action Plan \\nwill help the United Nations to keep making important \\ncontributions in this period of transformation.\\n\\nTwenty-two years ago I was present in the Assembly \\nto watch with great emotion the historic moment when \\nthe Republic of Korea was admitted as a State Member \\nof the United Nations. The moment came at the end \\nof a long wait during the Cold War. At that time the \\nRepublic of Korea solemnly pledged to actively take \\npart in the shaping of a new global order that is free, fair \\nand prosperous and where justice and the rule of law \\nprevail. To live up to this pledge, the Republic of Korea, \\nthough a latecomer, has fully embraced the callings of \\nthe United Nations with passion and devotion. In many \\ncorners of the world, Korea has actively taken part in \\npeacekeeping and reconstruction efforts. Currently, \\nKorea is serving as a member of the Security Council \\nand the Human Rights Council, among others.\\n\\nSince its inception, the United Nations has taken \\non the noble endeavour of helping the peoples of the \\nUnited Nations to live in larger freedom. However, \\ninsecurity and inequality, injustice and intolerance still \\nprevail in many parts of the world, where our common \\nefforts are desperately needed. Furthermore, the rise \\nof new global challenges, such as climate change, \\nterrorism and cybercrime, calls for global cooperation \\nthat transcends the existing inter-State system. In other \\nwords, the importance and the relevance of the United \\nNations is ever increasing, as it is a key vehicle for \\nglobal cooperation.\\n\\nThe new Administration of the Republic of Korea \\nhas put forward its foreign-policy vision, which is \\nbuilt on two fundamental objectives: “happiness of the \\npeople” and “happiness of the global community”. Such \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\na vision resonates with the core values of the United \\nNations — peace, human rights and development.\\n\\nKorea seeks to make meaningful contributions to \\nmaintain global peace beyond the Korean peninsula. \\nWe want to share the fruits of our economic success, \\nwhich was achieved with the help of the international \\ncommunity, and strive to enhance the dignity and \\nhappiness of all global citizens. I believe that that is \\nin line with the purposes and principles of the United \\nNations as well.\\n\\nThe first pillar in attaining global happiness is \\nsecurity. In particular, the Republic of Korea is of \\nthe view that the proliferation of weapons of mass \\ndestruction and their means of delivery is one of the \\nmost serious threats to international peace and security.\\n\\nIn that connection, the use of chemical weapons \\nin Syria, as confirmed by the report of the United \\nNations investigators (A/67/997), has caused the worst \\nhumanitarian disaster in the twenty-first century. The \\nGovernment of the Republic of Korea condemns the use \\nof chemical weapons in the strongest possible terms, as \\nit constitutes a crime against humanity that cannot be \\ntolerated under any circumstances.\\n\\nIn that regard, we welcome the recent agreement \\nbetween the United States and Russia on the Framework \\nfor Elimination of Syrian Chemical Weapons, \\nand expect a decision by the Organization for the \\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons. and a reinforcing \\nresolution by the Security Council, sometime today. We \\nurge the Syrian Government to faithfully implement its \\ncommitments to the international community. We also \\nstrongly call upon all countries that have not acceded \\nto the Chemical Weapons Convention, including the \\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, to do so as \\nsoon as possible.\\n\\nIn that context, I must draw attention to the \\nseriousness of the Democratic People’s Republic’s \\nongoing weapons of mass destruction (WMD) \\nprogrammes. Despite a series of Security Council \\nresolutions, the Democratic People’s Republic launched \\nlong-range missiles and conducted nuclear tests as \\nrecently as in early 2013, in blatant violation of its \\ninternational obligations. It should strictly implement \\nits obligations under the relevant Security Council \\nresolutions, including resolution 2094 (2013). As is the \\ncase with Syria, the international community should \\nmake united efforts to roll back the Democratic People’s \\nRepublic’s nuclear-weapons programmes to prevent \\nthe advent of another nuclear-armed State. However, \\nif it decides to give up its so-called parallel pursuit \\nof economic development and nuclear armament and \\nin turn embarks on a path of genuine change through \\nconcrete actions, the Republic of Korea stands ready to \\nhelp the Democratic People’s Republic.\\n\\nAlongside the proliferation of WMD, terrorism \\npresents a grave threat to international peace and \\nsecurity in the twenty-first century. The Republic of \\nKorea strongly condemns the terrorist attack that took \\nplace last weekend in Nairobi, Kenya. Our sincere \\ncondolences go out to the victims and their families of \\nthe tragedy. The Government of the Republic of Korea \\ndenounces all forms of terrorism and will continue to \\ntake part in the global efforts to combat terrorism.\\n\\nTogether with its efforts to respond to the imminent \\nsecurity threats, including the proliferation of WMD, \\nthe new Administration of the Republic of Korea is \\npursuing a policy that it calls “trustpolitik”, to establish \\na regional order of reconciliation and cooperation \\nin the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia. Our \\ntrustpolitik, in turn, is implemented through the Korean \\nPeninsula Trust-Building Process and the Northeast \\nAsia Peace and Cooperation Initiative.\\n\\nThe Korean Peninsula Trust-Building Process \\naspires to safeguard peace based on strong deterrence, \\nwhile simultaneously building peace through dialogue \\nand cooperation. Through that process, the new \\nAdministration of the Republic of Korea was able to \\nensure the resumption of operations in the Kaesong \\nindustrial park, the only remaining inter-Korean \\neconomic cooperation project.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Republic of Korea proposes to \\ncreate a world peace park in the world’s most heavily \\narmed demilitarized zone, in order to transform a \\nlasting legacy of the Cold War and a divided Korea into \\na new space of peace and harmony. It is my hope that the \\nUnited Nations and the two Koreas will work together \\nto bring this proposal to fruition, thereby contributing \\ngreatly to the building of trust in the Korean peninsula.\\n\\nTurning to the broader region of North-East Asia, \\nKorea is expecting further political and security \\ncooperation that corresponds to the level of economic \\ninterdependence in the region. To that end, the \\nRepublic of Korea proposed the Northeast Asia Peace \\nand Cooperation Initiative, which will open dialogue \\non soft issues of common interests to the players in \\nthe region. The Republic of Korea is also interested in \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nlearning from the valuable experiences in successful \\nregional institutions, such as the European Union, the \\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \\nand the Regional Forum of the Association of Southeast \\nAsian Nations.\\n\\nThe second pillar of an era of global happiness \\nis the promotion of human rights and human dignity \\nas universal values. In the past century, the Republic \\nof Korea went through a colonial occupation and a \\ntragic internecine war. From that experience, Koreans \\nbecame more appreciative than others of the paramount \\nimportance of human rights and humanitarianism.\\n\\nWorldwide, there is an alarming increase in the \\nnumber of refugees and internally displaced persons \\nowing to wars and intra-State conflicts. Concerning \\nthe massive refugee problem caused by the Syrian \\ncivil war, my Government is actively involved in \\ninternational efforts to assist the refugees. Korea is \\nalso planning to co-host a working group meeting \\non Syrian reconstruction in Seoul next month. The \\nRepublic of Korea also wishes to emphasize the need to \\nuphold the internationally established legal principle of \\nnon-refoulement.\\n\\nToday, there are over 10 million people in Korea \\nsuffering from the agony of not being able to see their \\nloved ones across the inter-Korean border, even 60 years \\nafter the end of the Korean War. Based on the recent \\nagreement between the two Koreas, a reunion for those \\nseparated families was to be held this week. However, \\nto our utmost regret, the Democratic People’s Republic \\nof Korea unilaterally cancelled that reunion, which \\nwould have been a humanitarian event, citing political \\nreasons. Such an inhumane decision cannot be justified \\nfor any sound reason. Thus far, the new Administration \\nof the Republic of Korea has maintained the insulation \\nof humanitarian issues from political considerations. \\nI therefore urge the Democratic People’s Republic of \\nKorea to convene the family reunion as soon as possible \\nso as to ease the pain and suffering of the Korean people \\nas a whole.\\n\\nThe Republic of Korea wishes to draw the attention \\nof the Assembly to the increasing need to protect \\ncivilians, including women and children, from armed \\nconflicts around the globe. With that in mind, during \\nits presidency of the Security Council in February, \\nthe Republic of Korea chaired an open debate on the \\nprotection of civilians in armed conflict (see S/PV.6917). \\nWe are also one of the champions of the newly launched \\nprotection from sexual violence initiative. In fact, \\nsexual violence during conflicts is one of the most \\nserious types of human rights violation. It is a war \\ncrime that not only destroys the life of the victim, but \\nalso that of the victim’s family and the community.\\n\\nIn particular, for the victims of sexual violence \\nduring conflicts of the past century, the pain and \\nthe agony continue to this day. What matters most is \\ngenuine remorse and concrete actions. As repeatedly \\nemphasized in reports of United Nations special \\nrapporteurs on sexual violence, responsible measures \\nare called for that can restore the honour of the victims \\nand soothe their pain, as such crimes involve a universal \\nhuman rights issue.\\n\\nUnderdevelopment and extreme poverty are the \\ncore challenges facing the United Nations today. Since \\nthe Millennium Summit was held in 2000, the collective \\nefforts by the international community to reach the \\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) have yielded \\nsome very tangible results. However, progress has not \\nbeen equally enjoyed across all regions, countries and \\ngroups of people. It is against that backdrop that we \\nattach great importance to discussions on the future \\ndirection of and road map for development cooperation, \\nunder the theme of “The post-2015 development agenda: \\nsetting the stage”, at the present session of the General \\nAssembly.\\n\\nThe next set of common global development goals \\nshould be genuinely people-centred and take into \\naccount a standard of well-being that goes beyond the \\ntraditional income levels. The new goals should place \\nthe greatest priority on guaranteeing the dignity of all. \\nFurthermore, they should seek to build partnerships \\nwith the newly emerging development actors, so as to \\neffectively utilize available capacities and resources. \\nThe Republic of Korea hopes that the Busan Global \\nPartnership for Effective Development Cooperation, \\nlaunched in 2012, will also play a significant role in \\nsetting up a new cooperative mechanism to lead the \\nimplementation of the post-2015 development agenda.\\n\\nSuch development goals also coincide with Korea’s \\nforeign policy objective of building an era of global \\nhappiness. The Republic of Korea hopes to work \\ntogether to complete the unfinished business of the \\nMDGs by pursuing a recipient-oriented development \\ncooperation policy. More specifically, we will continue \\nto increase our official development assistance and \\nshare our successful development experiences, such as \\nthe Saemaul Undong, or New Community Movement, \\nwith developing countries.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nIn addition, a united response to climate change \\nis critical to achieving global happiness. Korea will \\nactively support the Green Climate Fund, headquartered \\nin Korea, so that it develops into a significant \\norganization that supports developing countries in \\nresponding to climate change and the threats it brings.\\n\\nDeepening global interdependence has led to \\nthe rise of challenges requiring a common response. \\nExpectations of the role to be played by the United \\nNations are now higher than ever before. Indeed, the \\nUnited Nations has made great contributions as the \\ncentre of global cooperation and is expected to continue \\nin those noble endeavours. As former Secretary-General \\nDag Hammarskjöld once said, we should\\n\\n“recognize the United Nations for what it is — an \\nadmittedly imperfect but indispensable instrument \\nof nations working for a peaceful evolution towards \\na more just and secure world order”.\\nI am reminded of the solemn pledge that my \\nGovernment made 22 years ago — that the Republic \\nof Korea will actively contribute to the resolution of \\nglobal challenges through the United Nations. Today, I \\nstand before the Assembly to reaffirm the commitment \\nof the new Government of the Republic of Korea — that \\nKorea will contribute to realizing the era of global \\nhappiness by achieving the goals set out by the United \\nNations. It is only when we make common and collective \\nefforts toward advancing the universal values of peace, \\ndevelopment and human rights that the United Nations \\nwill truly become the parliament of humankind.\\n',\n",
       " 'There are two years left \\nuntil the deadline for achievement of the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals. It is therefore time to review what \\nwe have succeeded in achieving and set the guidelines \\nfor the work that remains.\\n\\nDevelopment is a global challenge. Every \\ncontribution that is made, every experience that we \\nshare and every lesson that we have learned is very \\nimportant for all of us. By sharing we set the stage for \\nlearning from each other — and not only from our own \\nmistakes. In today’s world, every country has the right \\nto choose a path that best suits its experience, culture \\nand needs, as long as it does not infringe upon the rights \\nof others and guarantees human rights and freedoms. \\nThe international community has an obligation to \\noffer support based on the principles of ownership and \\nempowerment so that those choices may be realized.\\n\\nDevelopment cannot be imposed; it must be \\npromoted. But it is not only about development. It is \\nabout free choice, democracy and fundamental rights, \\neach of which is key to the success of the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals and the post-2015 development \\nagenda. \\n\\nToday we live in the twenty-first century, but there \\nare still those who want to enforce a specific course \\nof development on others, using economic pressure, \\nenergy levers or cybertools, by distorted information \\nor threats. It is true that internationally approved \\nsanctions send a message to those who are producing \\nweapons and not jobs, who violate human rights and \\nuse national resources to satisfy individual interests \\nand not those of their society as a whole. But the use of \\neconomic, energy or information tools to show power \\nor set up zones of influence is unjustifiable, especially \\nfor the future.\\n\\nThe twenty-first century should be the age of \\nsolidarity, equality and sustainable development. It \\ncannot be an age of the flaunting of power, zero-sum \\ngames or buffer zones. Those times are over. Any attempt \\nto return to those times impedes the development of the \\nmodern world. But, regrettably, power games still exist.\\n\\nI would like to share my country’s and region’s \\nexperience with the Assembly. In the past two decades, \\nthe Baltic States have been rapidly transformed. Complex \\nand painful economic, political and social reforms \\nhave boosted economic growth, social well-being and \\npolitical stability. After rebuilding our statehood two \\ndecades ago and with the help, advice and experience \\nof the international community, our nations have today \\nbecome donors and have a lot of experience to share \\nwith those who are going through transformations \\nsimilar to the ones we have experienced. \\n\\nInner resolve and consensus are very important. \\nHowever, a favourable external climate and \\ninternational support are also needed, especially for \\nsmall countries that depend on larger players for their \\ntrade, transportation or energy links.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn two months’ time, in Vilnius, several Eastern \\nEuropean countries intend to confirm their commitment \\nto completing the painful but much-needed reforms \\nfor economic growth, political stability and social \\nharmony. For many years, those countries worked \\nhard to reach national agreement on reforms, their \\nscope and direction. They learned from their mistakes \\nand mobilized resources to build their own futures. \\nThey chose to build modern States of the twenty-first \\ncentury — open, transparent and collaborative, not \\ndominating.\\n\\nIt was not easy for those countries to decide which \\ncourse to take. Their choice would have been made easier \\nif their free will had been respected and their decision \\nsupported in good faith, and with encouragement by \\nthose who could provide such support. Instead, they \\nare now facing trade restrictions, bans on goods, the \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nmanipulation of energy prices, the use of pressure and \\nopen disrespect displayed in information forums.\\n\\nThe countries of the European Union Eastern \\nPartnership are not the only ones experiencing such \\nproblems. Even Lithuania, which holds the presidency \\nof the Council of the European Union and has \\nsuccessfully consolidated its course of development, is \\nunder similar pressure. Barriers to travel, unreasonable \\ndelays in cargo transportation, the milk wars — those \\nare just a few very recent controversial examples. For \\nnations, the decision is really difficult to make when free \\nchoice means being threatened with gas-price increases \\nand blocked trade, instead of receiving support and \\nadvice. Under such pressure, it is hard to implement \\nreforms that empower members of society and open up \\nopportunities to engage in the state-building process.\\n\\nThe post-2015 development agenda must provide \\ninstruments that empower States to seek development, \\nbased on free will and their individual needs. There is no \\nplace for forced choices, open threats or demonstrations \\nof power. The international community, especially the \\nUnited Nations, should empower States to realize such \\nself-determination. I urge us all to give the matter our \\nvery careful attention.\\n',\n",
       " 'Each year we come together to \\nreaffirm the founding vision of this institution. For most \\nof recorded history, individual aspirations were subject \\nto the whims of tyrants and empires, and divisions of \\nrace, religion and tribe were settled through the sword \\nand the clash of armies. \\n\\nThe idea that nations and peoples could come \\ntogether in peace to solve their disputes and advance a \\ncommon prosperity seemed unimaginable. It took the \\nawful carnage of two world wars to shift our thinking. \\nThe leaders who built the United Nations were not naive. \\nThey did not think that this body could eradicate all \\nwars. But in the wake of millions dead and continents \\nin rubble and with the development of nuclear weapons \\nthat could annihilate a planet, they understood that \\nhumanity could not survive the course it was on. They \\ngave us this institution, believing that it could allow \\nus to resolve conflicts, enforce rules of behaviour and \\nbuild habits of cooperation that would grow stronger \\nover time.\\n\\nFor decades, the United Nations has in fact made \\na difference, from helping to eradicate disease to \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\neducating children and brokering peace. But like \\nevery generation of leaders, we face new and profound \\nchallenges, and this body continues to be tested. The \\nquestion is whether we possess the wisdom and the \\ncourage as nation States and members of an international \\ncommunity to squarely meet those challenges. Can the \\nUnited Nations meet the test of our time?\\n\\nAnd for much of my tenure as President, some of \\nour most urgent challenges have revolved around an \\nincreasingly integrated global economy and our efforts \\nto recover from the worst economic crisis of our lifetime. \\nNow, five years after the global economy collapsed and \\nthanks to coordinated efforts by the countries here \\ntoday, jobs are being created, global financial systems \\nhave stabilized and people are once again being lifted \\nout of poverty. But this progress is fragile and unequal, \\nand we still have work to do together to assure that our \\ncitizens can access the opportunities that they need in \\norder to thrive in the twenty-first century.\\n\\nTogether, we have also worked to end a decade of \\nwar. Five years ago nearly 180,000 Americans were \\nserving in harm’s way, and the war in Iraq was the \\ndominant issue in our relationship with the rest of the \\nworld. Today, all of our troops have left Iraq. Next year an \\ninternational coalition will end its war in Afghanistan, \\nhaving achieved its mission of dismantling the core of \\nAl Qaida that attacked us on 9/11.\\n\\nFor the United States, those new circumstances \\nhave also meant shifting away from a perpetual war \\nfooting. Beyond bringing our troops home we have \\nlimited the use of drones so that they target only those \\nwho pose a continuing imminent threat to the United \\nStates, when capture is not feasible and when there \\nis a near certainty of no civilian casualties. We are \\ntransferring detainees to other countries and trying \\nterrorists in courts of law, while working diligently to \\nclose the prison at Guantanamo Bay. Just as we have \\nreviewed how we deploy our extraordinary military \\ncapabilities in a way that lives up to our ideals, we have \\nbegun to review the way that we gather intelligence, \\nso that we properly balance the legitimate security \\nconcerns of our citizens and allies with the privacy \\nconcerns that all people share.\\n\\nAs a result of such work and cooperation with \\nallies and partners, the world is more stable than it was \\nfive years ago. But even a glance at today’s headlines \\nindicates that dangers remain. In Kenya, we have \\nseen terrorists target innocent civilians in a crowded \\nshopping mall. Our hearts go out to the families of \\nthose who have been affected. In Pakistan, nearly 100 \\npeople were recently killed by suicide bombers outside \\na church. In Iraq, killings and car bombs continue to be \\na terrible part of life.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Al-Qaida has splintered into regional \\nnetworks and militias, which does not give them the \\ncapacity at this point to carry out attacks like 9/11 \\nbut does pose serious threats to Governments and \\ndiplomats, businesses and civilians all across the globe. \\nJust as significantly, the convulsions in the Middle East \\nand North Africa have laid bare deep divisions within \\nsocieties, as an old order is upended and people grapple \\nwith what is coming next. Peaceful movements have too \\noften been answered by violence from those resisting \\nchange and from extremists trying to hijack change. \\nSectarian conflict has re-emerged, and the potential \\nspread of weapons of mass destruction continues to cast \\na shadow over the pursuit of peace.\\n\\nNowhere have we seen those trends converge \\nmore powerfully than in Syria. There, peaceful \\nprotests against an authoritarian regime were met with \\nrepression and slaughter. In the face of such carnage, \\nmany retreated to their sectarian identities — Alawite \\nand Sunni, Christian and Kurd — and the situation \\nspiralled into civil war.\\n\\nThe international community recognized the stakes \\nearly on, but our response has not matched the scale of \\nthe challenge. Aid cannot keep pace with the suffering \\nof the wounded and displaced. A peace process is \\nstillborn. America and others have worked to bolster \\nthe moderate opposition, but extremist groups have still \\ntaken root to exploit the crisis.\\n\\nAl-Assad’s traditional allies have propped him up, \\nciting principles of sovereignty to shield his regime. \\nOn 21 August, the regime used chemical weapons in \\nan attack that killed more than 1,000 people, including \\nhundreds of children. Today, the crisis in Syria and the \\ndestabilization of the region goes to the heart of broader \\nchallenges that the international community must now \\nconfront. How should we respond to conflicts in the \\nMiddle East and North Africa — conflicts between \\ncountries, but also conflicts within them? How do we \\naddress the choice between standing callously by while \\nchildren are subjected to nerve gas and embroiling \\nourselves in someone else’s civil war? What is the role of \\nforce in resolving disputes that threaten the stability of \\na region and undermine all basic standards of civilized \\nconduct? And what is the role of the United Nations and \\ninternational law in meeting cries for justice?\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nToday, I want to outline where the United States of \\nAmerica stands on those issues.\\n\\nWith respect to Syria, we believe that, as a starting \\npoint, the international community must enforce the ban \\non chemical weapons. When I stated my willingness to \\norder a limited strike against the Al-Assad regime in \\nresponse to its brazen use of chemical weapons, I did \\nnot do so lightly. I did so because I believe that it is \\nin the national security interests of the United States \\nand in the interest of the world to meaningfully enforce \\na prohibition whose origins are older than the United \\nNations itself. The ban against the use of chemical \\nweapons, even in war, has been agreed to by 98 percent \\nof humanity. It is strengthened by the searing memories \\nof soldiers suffocated in the trenches, Jews slaughtered \\nin gas chambers, Iranians poisoned in the many tens of \\nthousands.\\n\\nThe evidence is overwhelming that the Al-Assad \\nregime used such weapons on 21 August. United \\nNations inspectors gave a clear accounting of their \\nfindings that advanced rockets had fired large \\nquantities of sarin gas at civilians. Those rockets were \\nfired from a regime-controlled neighbourhood and \\nlanded in opposition neighbourhoods. It is an insult to \\nhuman reason and to the legitimacy of this institution \\nto suggest that anyone other than the regime carried out \\nthis attack.\\n\\nI know that in the immediate aftermath of the attack \\nthere were those who questioned the legitimacy of even \\na limited strike in the absence of a clear mandate from \\nthe Security Council. But without a credible military \\nthreat, the Security Council had demonstrated no \\ninclination to act at all. However, as I have discussed \\nwith President Putin for over a year, most recently in \\nSt. Petersburg, my preference has always been to work \\nfor a diplomatic resolution to this issue, and in the past \\nseveral weeks, the United States, Russia and our allies \\nhave reached an agreement to place Syria’s chemical \\nweapons under international control and then destroy \\nthem.\\n\\nThe Syrian Government took a first step by giving \\nan accounting of its stockpiles. Now, there must be a \\nstrong Security Council resolution to verify that the \\nAl-Assad regime is keeping its commitments, and there \\nmust be consequences if they fail to do so. If we cannot \\nagree even on that, then that will show that the United \\nNations is incapable of enforcing the most basic of \\ninternational laws. On the other hand, if we succeed, it \\nwill send a powerful message that the use of chemical \\nweapons has no place in the twenty-first century and \\nthat this Organization means what it says.\\n\\nOur agreement on chemical weapons should \\nenergize a larger diplomatic effort to reach a political \\nsettlement within Syria. I do not believe that military \\naction by those within Syria or by external Powers can \\nachieve a lasting peace, nor do I believe that America \\nor any nation should determine who will lead Syria. \\nThat is for the Syrian people to decide. Nevertheless, a \\nleader who has slaughtered his own citizens and gassed \\nchildren to death cannot regain the legitimacy to lead \\na badly fractured country. The notion that Syria can \\nreturn to a pre-war status quo is a fantasy. \\n\\nIt is time for Russia and Iran to realize that insisting \\non Al-Assad’s rule will lead directly to the outcome that \\nthey fear — an increasingly violent space for extremists \\nto operate in. In turn, those of us who continue to \\nsupport the moderate opposition must persuade them \\nthat the Syrian people cannot afford a collapse of State \\ninstitutions and that a political settlement cannot be \\nreached without addressing the legitimate fears and \\nconcerns of Alawites and other minorities. \\n\\nWe are committed to working this political track, \\nand as we pursue a settlement, let us remember that \\nthis is not a zero-sum endeavour. We are no longer in \\na cold war. There is no great game to be won, nor does \\nAmerica have any interest in Syria beyond the well-\\nbeing of its people, the stability of its neighbours, the \\nelimination of chemical weapons and ensuring that it \\ndoes not become a safe haven for terrorists. I welcome \\nthe influence of all nations that can help bring about a \\npeaceful resolution of Syria’s civil war. \\n\\nAs we move the Geneva process forward, I \\nurge all nations represented here to step up to meet \\nthe humanitarian needs in Syria and surrounding \\ncountries. America has committed over a billion dollars \\nto that effort, and today I can announce that we will be \\nproviding an additional $340 million. No aid can take \\nthe place of a political resolution that gives the Syrian \\npeople the chance to begin rebuilding their country, but \\nit can help desperate people survive.\\n\\nWhat broader conclusions can be drawn from \\nAmerica’s policy towards Syria? I know that there are \\nthose who have been frustrated by our unwillingness \\nto use our military might to depose Al-Assad and \\nbelieve that a failure to do so indicates a weakening of \\nAmerica’s resolve in the region. Others have suggested \\nthat my willingness to direct even limited military \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nstrikes to deter the further use of chemical weapons \\nshows that we have learned nothing from Iraq, and that \\nAmerica continues to seek control over the Middle East \\nfor our own purposes. The situation in Syria mirrors \\na contradiction that has persisted in the region for \\ndecades. The United States is chastised for meddling in \\nthe region and accused of having a hand in all manner \\nof conspiracies. At the same time, the United States is \\nblamed for failing to do enough to solve the region’s \\nproblems and for showing indifference toward suffering \\nMuslim populations.\\n\\nI realize that some of that is inevitable, given \\nAmerica’s role in the world, but such contradictory \\nattitudes have a practical impact on the American \\npeople’s support for our involvement in the region \\nand allow leaders in the region, and the international \\ncommunity sometimes, to avoid addressing difficult \\nproblems themselves. So let me take this opportunity \\nto outline what has been United States policy towards \\nthe Middle East and North Africa and what will be my \\npolicy during the remainder of my presidency.\\n\\nThe United States of America is prepared to use \\nall elements of our power, including military force, \\nto secure these core interests in the region. We will \\nconfront external aggression against our allies and \\npartners, as we did in the Gulf War. We will ensure \\nthe free flow of energy from the region to the world. \\nAlthough America is steadily reducing its own \\ndependence on imported oil, the world still depends \\nupon the region’s energy supply, and a severe disruption \\ncould destabilize the entire global economy. We will \\ndismantle terrorist networks that threaten our people. \\nWherever possible, we will build the capacity of our \\npartners, respect the sovereignty of nations and work \\nto address the root causes of terror, but when it is \\nnecessary to defend the United States against terrorist \\nattack, we will take direct action. Finally, we will not \\ntolerate the development or use of weapons of mass \\ndestruction. Just as we consider the use of chemical \\nweapons in Syria to be a threat to our own national \\nsecurity, we reject the development of nuclear weapons \\nthat could trigger a nuclear arms race in the region and \\nundermine the global non-proliferation regime.\\n\\nNow, to say that those are America’s core interests \\nis not to say that they are our only interests. We deeply \\nbelieve that it is in our interest to see a Middle East and \\nNorth Africa that are peaceful and prosperous, and we \\nwill continue to promote democracy, human rights and \\nopen markets, because we believe that those practices \\nhelp achieve peace and prosperity. But I also believe \\nthat we can rarely achieve those objectives through \\nunilateral American action, particularly military \\naction. Iraq has shown us that democracy cannot \\nsimply be imposed by force. Rather, such objectives are \\nbest achieved when we partner with the international \\ncommunity and with the countries and peoples of the \\nregion.\\n\\nSo what does that mean going forward? In the near \\nterm, America’s diplomatic efforts will focus on two \\nparticular issues: Iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons \\nand the Arab-Israeli conflict. While those issues are \\nnot the cause of all of the region’s problems, they have \\nbeen a major source of instability for far too long, and \\nresolving them can help serve as a foundation for a \\nbroader peace.\\n\\nThe United States and Iran have been isolated \\nfrom one another since the Islamic revolution of 1979. \\nThat mistrust has deep roots. Iranians have long \\ncomplained of a history of United States interference \\nin their affairs and of America’s role in overthrowing \\nan Iranian Government during the cold war. On the \\nother hand, Americans see an Iranian Government that \\nhas declared the United States an enemy and directly \\nor through proxies has taken Americans hostage, killed \\nUnited States troops and civilians and threatened our \\nally Israel with destruction.\\n\\nI do not believe such a difficult history can be \\novercome overnight. The suspicion runs too deep. But \\nI do believe that, if we can resolve the issue of Iran’s \\nnuclear programme, that can serve as a major step down \\na long road towards a different relationship, one based \\non mutual interests and mutual respect.\\n\\nSince I took office, I have made it clear, in letters \\nto the Supreme Leader in Iran and, more recently, to \\nPresident Rouhani, that America prefers to resolve its \\nconcerns over Iran’s nuclear programme peacefully, \\nalthough we are determined to prevent Iran from \\ndeveloping a nuclear weapon. We are not seeking regime \\nchange, and we respect the right of the Iranian people \\nto access peaceful nuclear energy. Instead, we insist \\nthat the Iranian Government meet its responsibilities \\nunder the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \\nWeapons and Security Council resolutions. Meanwhile, \\nthe Supreme Leader has issued a fatwa against the \\ndevelopment of nuclear weapons, and President \\nRouhani has just recently reiterated that the Islamic \\nRepublic will never develop a nuclear weapon.\\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nThose statements made by our respective \\nGovernments should offer the basis for a meaningful \\nagreement. We should be able to achieve a resolution \\nthat respects the rights of the Iranian people while \\ngiving the world confidence that the Iranian programme \\nis peaceful. But to succeed, conciliatory words will \\nhave to be matched by actions that are transparent and \\nverifiable. After all, it is the Iranian Government’s \\nchoices that have led to the comprehensive sanctions \\nthat are currently in place. That is not simply an issue \\nbetween the United States and Iran. The world has \\nseen Iran evade its responsibilities in the past and has \\nan abiding interest in making sure that Iran meets its \\nobligations in future.\\n\\nBut I want to be clear. We are encouraged by the \\nfact that President Rouhani received from the Iranian \\npeople a mandate to pursue a more moderate course. \\nGiven President Rouhani’s stated commitment to reach \\nan agreement, I am directing John Kerry to pursue this \\neffort with the Iranian Government, in close cooperation \\nwith the European Union, the United Kingdom, France, \\nGermany, Russia and China.\\n\\nThe roadblocks may prove to be too great, but I \\nfirmly believe that the diplomatic path must be tested. \\nFor while the status quo will only deepen Iran’s isolation, \\nIran’s genuine commitment to go down a different path \\nwill be good for the region and the world, and will help \\nthe Iranian people meet their extraordinary potential in \\ncommerce and culture, in science and education.\\n\\nWe are also determined to resolve a conflict that \\ngoes back even further than our differences with \\nIran: the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis. \\nI have made it clear that the United States will never \\ncompromise our commitment to Israel’s security, nor \\nour support for its existence as a Jewish State. Earlier \\nthis year, in Jerusalem, I was inspired by young Israelis \\nwho stood up for the belief that peace was necessary, \\njust and possible, and I believe that there is a growing \\nrecognition within Israel that the occupation of the West \\nBank is tearing at the democratic fabric of the Jewish \\nState. But the children of Israel have the right to live in \\na world where the nations assembled in this body fully \\nrecognize their country and where we unequivocally \\nreject those who fire rockets at their homes or incite \\nothers to hate them.\\n\\nLikewise, the United States remains committed to \\nthe belief that the Palestinian people have a right to live \\nin security and dignity in their own sovereign State. On \\nthe same trip, I had the opportunity to meet with young \\nPalestinians in Ramallah whose ambition and incredible \\npotential are matched only by the pain they feel in \\nhaving no firm place in the community of nations. They \\nare understandably cynical as to whether real progress \\nwill ever be made, and they are frustrated by their \\nfamilies enduring the daily indignity of occupation. \\nBut they, too, recognize that two States is the only real \\npath to peace, because, just as the Palestinian people \\nmust not be displaced, the State of Israel is here to stay.\\n\\nThe time is now ripe for the entire international \\ncommunity to get behind the pursuit of peace. Already \\nIsraeli and Palestinian leaders have demonstrated a \\nwillingness to take significant political risks. President \\nAbbas has put aside efforts to short-cut the pursuit \\nof peace and come to the negotiating table. Prime \\nMinister Netanyahu has released Palestinian prisoners \\nand reaffirmed his commitment to a Palestinian State. \\nCurrent talks are focused on final status issues of \\nborders and security, refugees and Jerusalem.\\n\\nSo now the rest of us must be willing to take risks \\nas well. Friends of Israel, including the United States, \\nmust recognize that Israel’s security as a Jewish and \\ndemocratic State depends upon the realization of a \\nPalestinian State, and we should say so clearly. Arab \\nStates, and those who have supported the Palestinians, \\nmust recognize that stability will be served only through \\na two-State solution and a secure Israel. All of us must \\nrecognize that peace will be a powerful tool to defeat \\nextremists throughout the region and embolden those \\nwho are prepared to build a better future. Moreover, \\nties of trade and commerce between Israelis and Arabs \\ncould be an engine of growth and opportunity at a \\ntime when too many young people in the region are \\nlanguishing without work. So let us emerge from the \\nfamiliar corners of blame and prejudice. Let us support \\nIsraeli and Palestinian leaders who are prepared to walk \\nthe difficult road to peace.\\n\\nReal breakthroughs on these two issues — Iran’s \\nnuclear programme and Israeli-Palestinian peace — would \\nhave a profound and positive impact on the entire Middle \\nEast and North Africa. But the current convulsions \\narising out of the Arab Spring remind us that a just and \\nlasting peace cannot be measured only by agreements \\nbetween nations. It must also be measured by our ability \\nto resolve conflict and promote justice within nations. \\nAnd by that measure, it is clear that all of us have a lot \\nmore work to do. \\n\\nWhen peaceful transitions began in Tunisia and \\nEgypt, the entire world was filled with hope. And \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nalthough the United States, like others, was struck by \\nthe speed of transition, and although we did not — and \\nin fact could not — dictate events, we chose to support \\nthose who called for change. We did so based on the \\nbelief that while these transitions will be hard and take \\ntime, societies based upon democracy and openness \\nand the dignity of the individual will ultimately be \\nmore stable, more prosperous and more peaceful. \\n\\nOver the last few years, particularly in Egypt, \\nwe have seen just how hard this transition will be. \\nMohammed Morsi was democratically elected, but \\nproved unwilling or unable to govern in a way that was \\nfully inclusive. The interim Government that replaced \\nhim responded to the desires of millions of Egyptians \\nwho believed the revolution had taken a wrong turn, but \\nit, too, has made decisions inconsistent with inclusive \\ndemocracy, through an emergency law and restrictions \\non the press, civil society and opposition parties.\\n\\nOf course, America has been attacked by all sides \\nof this internal conflict, simultaneously accused of \\nsupporting the Muslim Brotherhood and engineering \\nits removal from power. In fact, the United States has \\npurposely avoided choosing sides. Our overriding \\ninterest throughout these past few years has been to \\nencourage a Government that legitimately reflects \\nthe will of the Egyptian people and recognizes true \\ndemocracy as requiring a respect for minority rights, \\nthe rule of law, freedom of speech and assembly, and a \\nstrong civil society.\\n\\nThat remains our interest today. And so, going \\nforward, the United States will maintain a constructive \\nrelationship with the interim Government that promotes \\ncore interests like the Camp David Accords and counter-\\nterrorism. We will continue support in areas such as \\neducation that directly benefit the Egyptian people. \\nBut we have not proceeded with the delivery of certain \\nmilitary systems, and our support will depend upon \\nEgypt’s progress in pursuing a more democratic path. \\n\\nOur approach to Egypt reflects a larger point: the \\nUnited States will at times work with Governments \\nthat do not meet — at least in our view — the highest \\ninternational expectations, but who work with us on our \\ncore interests. Nevertheless, we will not stop asserting \\nprinciples that are consistent with our ideals, whether \\nthat means opposing the use of violence as a means \\nof suppressing dissent or supporting the principles \\nembodied in the Universal Declaration of Human \\nRights. We will reject the notion that those principles \\nare simply Western exports, incompatible with Islam or \\nthe Arab world. We believe that they are the birthright \\nof every person. And while we recognize that our \\ninfluence will at times be limited, although we will be \\nwary of efforts to impose democracy through military \\nforce, and although we will at times be accused of \\nhypocrisy and inconsistency, we will be engaged in the \\nregion for the long haul. For the hard work of forging \\nfreedom and democracy is the task of a generation. \\nThat includes efforts to resolve sectarian tensions that \\ncontinue to surface in places like Iraq, Bahrain and \\nSyria. \\n\\nWe understand that such long-standing issues \\ncannot be solved by outsiders; they must be addressed \\nby Muslim communities themselves. But we have seen \\ngrinding conflicts come to an end before, most recently \\nin Northern Ireland, where Catholics and Protestants \\nfinally recognized that an endless cycle of conflict was \\ncausing both communities to fall behind a fast-moving \\nworld. And so we believe that those same sectarian \\nconflicts can be overcome in the Middle East and North \\nAfrica. \\n\\nTo summarize, the United States has a hard-earned \\nhumility when it comes to our ability to determine \\nevents inside other countries. The notion of American \\nempire may be useful propaganda, but it is not borne \\nout by America’s current policy or public opinion. \\nIndeed, as recent debates within the United States over \\nSyria clearly showed, the danger for the world is not an \\nAmerica that is too eager to immerse itself in the affairs \\nof other countries or to take on every problem in the \\nregion as its own. The danger for the world is that the \\nUnited States, after a decade of war, rightly concerned \\nabout issues back home and aware of the hostility \\nthat our engagement in the region has engendered \\nthroughout the Muslim world, may disengage, creating \\na vacuum of leadership that no other nation is ready to \\nfill.\\n\\nI believe that such disengagement would be a \\nmistake. I believe that America must remain engaged \\nfor our own security, but I also believe that the world \\nis better for it. Some may disagree, but I believe that \\nAmerica is exceptional, in part because we have shown \\na willingness, through the sacrifice of blood and \\ntreasure, to stand up not only for our own narrow self-\\ninterest, but for the interests of all. I must be honest, \\nthough; we are far more likely to invest our energy \\nin those countries that want to work with us, that \\ninvest in their people instead of in a corrupt few, and \\nthat embrace a vision of society where everyone can \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\ncontribute — men and women, Shia or Sunni, Muslim, \\nChristian or Jew. Because from Europe to Asia, from \\nAfrica to the Americas, nations that have persevered on \\na democratic path have emerged more prosperous, more \\npeaceful and more invested in upholding our common \\nsecurity and our common humanity. And I believe that \\nthe same will hold true for the Arab world.\\n\\nThat leads me to a final point. There will be \\ntimes when the breakdown of societies is so great and \\nthe violence against civilians so substantial, that the \\ninternational community will be called upon to act. \\nThat will require new thinking and some very tough \\nchoices. While the United Nations was designed to \\nprevent wars between States, increasingly we face \\nthe challenge of preventing slaughter within States. \\nAnd those challenges will grow more pronounced \\nas we are confronted with States that are fragile or \\nfailing — places where horrendous violence can put \\ninnocent men, women and children at risk with no hope \\nof protection from their national institutions.\\n\\nI have made it clear that even when America’s core \\ninterests are not directly threatened, we stand ready to \\ndo our part to prevent mass atrocities and protect basic \\nhuman rights. But we cannot and should not bear that \\nburden alone. In Mali, we supported both the French \\nintervention that successfully pushed back Al-Qaida \\nand the African forces who are keeping the peace. In \\nEast Africa, we are working with partners to bring the \\nLord’s Resistance Army to an end. And in Libya, when \\nthe Security Council provided a mandate to protect \\ncivilians, America joined a coalition that took action. \\nBecause of what we did there, countless lives were \\nsaved and a tyrant could not kill his way back to power.\\n\\nI know that some now criticize the action in \\nLibya as an object lesson. They point to the problems \\nthat the country now confronts — a democratically \\nelected Government struggling to provide security; \\narmed groups, in some places extremists, ruling parts \\nof a fractured land — and these critics argue that any \\nintervention to protect civilians is doomed to fail. Look \\nat Libya. No one is more mindful of those problems \\nthan I am, for they resulted in the death of four \\noutstanding United States citizens who were committed \\nto the Libyan people, including Ambassador Chris \\nStevens — a man whose courageous efforts helped save \\nthe city of Benghazi. But does anyone truly believe that \\nthe situation in Libya would be better if Al-Qadhafi had \\nbeen allowed to kill, imprison or brutalize his people \\ninto submission? It is far more likely that without \\ninternational action, Libya would now be engulfed in \\ncivil war and bloodshed.\\n\\nWe live in a world of imperfect choices. Different \\nnations will not agree on the need for action in every \\ninstance, and the principle of sovereignty is at the centre \\nof our international order. But sovereignty cannot be \\na shield for tyrants to commit wanton murder or an \\nexcuse for the international community to turn a blind \\neye. While we need to be modest in our belief that we \\ncan remedy every evil, and while we need to be mindful \\nthat the world is full of unintended consequences, \\nshould we really accept the notion that the world is \\npowerless in the face of a Rwanda or a Srebrenica? If \\nthat is the world that people want to live in, they should \\nsay so and reckon with the cold logic of mass graves.\\n\\nI believe that we can embrace a different future. If \\nwe do not want to choose between inaction and war, we \\nmust get better — all of us — at the policies that prevent \\nthe breakdown of basic order through respect for the \\nresponsibilities of nations and the rights of individuals, \\nthrough meaningful sanctions for those who break \\nthe rules, through dogged diplomacy that resolves the \\nroot causes of conflict and not merely its aftermath, \\nand through development assistance that brings hope \\nto the marginalized. And yes sometimes, all this will \\nnot be enough and there will be moments when the \\ninternational community will need to acknowledge that \\nthe multilateral use of military force may be required to \\nprevent the very worst from occurring. \\n\\nUltimately, that is the international community \\nthat America seeks — one where nations do not covet \\nthe land or resources of other nations, but one in which \\nwe carry out the founding purpose of this institution \\nand where we all take responsibility; a world in which \\nthe rules established out of the horrors of war can help \\nus resolve conflicts peacefully and prevent the kind of \\nwars that our forefathers fought; a world where human \\nbeings can live with dignity and meet their basic needs, \\nwhether they live in New York or Nairobi, in Peshawar \\nor Damascus.\\n\\nThese are extraordinary times with extraordinary \\nopportunities. Thanks to human progress, a child \\nborn anywhere on Earth today can do things that \\n60 years ago would have been out of reach for the mass \\nof humankind. I saw this in Africa, where nations \\nmoving beyond conflict are now poised to take off. \\nAmerica is with them: partnering to feed the hungry \\nand to care for the sick and to bring power to places \\noff the grid. I see it across the Pacific region, where \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nhundreds of millions have been lifted out of poverty in \\na single generation. I see it in the faces of young people \\neverywhere who can access the entire world with the \\nclick of a button and who are eager to join the cause of \\neradicating extreme poverty, combating climate change, \\nstarting businesses, expanding freedom, and leaving \\nbehind the old ideological battles of the past. That is \\nwhat is happening in Asia and Africa, it is happening \\nin Europe and the Americas. That is the future that the \\npeople of the Middle East and North Africa deserve as \\nwell, one where they can focus on opportunity, instead \\nof on whether they will be killed or repressed because \\nof who they are or what they believe. \\n\\nTime and again, nations and people have shown \\na capacity to change, to live up to humanity’s highest \\nideals, to choose a better history. Last month, I stood \\nwhere 50 years ago Martin Luther King Jr. told America \\nabout his dream, at a time when many people of my \\nrace could not even vote for President. Earlier this year, \\nI stood in the small cell where Nelson Mandela endured \\nfor decades, cut off from his own people and the world. \\nWho are we to believe that today’s challenges cannot be \\novercome, when we have seen what changes the human \\nspirit can bring? Who in this Hall can argue that the \\nfuture belongs to those who seek to repress that spirit, \\nrather than to those who seek to liberate it? \\n\\nI know what side of history I want the United States \\nof America to be on. We are ready to meet tomorrow’s \\nchallenges with you, firm in the belief that all men \\nand women are in fact created equal, each individual \\npossessed with a dignity and inalienable rights that \\ncannot be denied. That is why we look to the future \\nnot with fear, but with hope. That is why we remain \\nconvinced that this community of nations can deliver \\na more peaceful, prosperous, and just world to the next \\ngeneration. \\n',\n",
       " 'In the 364 days since I last had \\nthe honour to address this Assembly, the world has \\nchanged dramatically. We have seen a profound change \\nin the global security situation. We see unprecedented \\nthreats to peace and security in post-Second World War \\nEurope and the world, while terrorism, climate change, \\nhuman rights violations and the spread of the Ebola \\nvirus continue to be global challenges.\\n\\nWe need a concerted effort to achieve peace and \\nstability in Europe and the Middle East, and to restore \\nthe credibility of international law. No circumstances \\ncan ever justify terrorism in any form. By signing \\nUnited Nations anti-terrorism conventions States have \\npromised to prevent and investigate terrorist crimes as \\nwell as to refrain from supporting or tacitly tolerating \\nthose crimes.\\n\\nThe Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) \\nposes a serious threat to the people of Iraq and Syria \\nas well as the broader Middle East. This terrorist \\norganization executes prisoners, kills civilians and \\ncommits genocidal acts against religious and national \\nminorities. Its brutality, barbarous crimes and extreme \\nideology threaten all of humanity. It challenges the \\nuniversal human values enshrined in United Nations \\ndocuments. We must stop the terrorists. Estonia \\ncommends all global efforts to fight the ISIL and other \\nterrorist organizations and stands ready to contribute \\nto those efforts. I should like to welcome the adoption \\ntoday of Security Council resolution 2178 (2014), on \\nforeign terrorist fighters.\\n\\nA quarter of a century ago in the annus mirabilis \\n1989, Europe and the democratic world celebrated an \\nhistorical sea change. The Berlin Wall fell. The Cold \\nWar that had divided the world into hostile camps for \\nhalf a century ended. This year we should celebrate an \\nanniversary of the triumph of freedom and democracy. \\nInstead, 2014 has turned out to be a year when the \\ninternational order as we have known it since the \\ncold war, has been violated and put in doubt. Cynical \\ngeopolitics in international relations has once again \\ncome to the fore. The international agreements upon \\nwhich the stability of the post-Second World War \\nsecurity architecture relied, have been compromised.\\n\\nLet me recall what we have collectively agreed \\nupon. The Charter of the United Nations of 1945 \\ndeclares:\\n\\n“All Members shall refrain in their international \\nrelations from the threat or use of force against the \\nterritorial integrity or political independence of \\nany state”.\\nIn the Helsinki Final Act of 1975, all trans-Atlantic \\ncountries agreed not to use force to change borders \\nor challenge the political independence of any State. \\nStates agreed to regard one another’s frontiers as \\ninviolable; to refrain from making each other’s territory \\nthe object of military organized occupation. No such \\noccupation or acquisition would be recognized as legal. \\nIn the 1990 Conference on Security and Cooperation in \\nEurope (CSCE) Charter of Paris for a New Europe, all \\nsignatories, from Vancouver to Vladivostok, agreed to \\n“fully recognize the freedom of States to choose their \\nown security arrangements”.\\nBy annexing Crimea and invading Eastern \\nUkraine, one of the signatories has violated all of these \\nagreements. Thus, we find ourselves in a completely \\nnew and unforeseen security environment. We must \\nenforce the fundamental agreements upon which our \\npeace and security rely.\\n\\nThe Ukrainian crisis is not solely a conflict \\nbetween two countries. It is not even solely a European \\nissue. If instead of agreements and laws raw brute force \\nwill apply in international relations; if changing State \\nborders by force will become an accepted norm, then the \\nstability of the whole world is threatened. As President \\nObama said this morning, “This is a vision of the world \\nin which might makes right” (A/69/PV.6, p. 11). And he \\nadded, “We believe that right makes might” (ibid.). So \\ndoes Estonia. We believe that too.\\n\\n\\n\\nSuch developments must be firmly condemned. \\nThe international community cannot leave Crimea as \\nit is now. We cannot accept frozen conflicts created for \\ngeopolitical ends. Referendums that are in agreement \\nwith international law cannot be arranged in two weeks in \\nthe presence of foreign armed forces. The results of such \\nreferendums cannot be considered valid. Independence, \\nsovereignty and territorial integrity must remain the \\nfundamental rights of States and nations. That includes \\ntheir right to direct their own future and to choose their \\nallies, as stated in the CSCE Paris Charter. Such free \\nchoices by sovereign nations cannot be accepted as an \\nexcuse for aggression. However, it was not Ukraine’s \\nwish even to choose its security arrangements that was \\nused as justification for aggression. Its mere desire to \\nenhance trade and political relations with the European \\nUnion, which is not a security arrangement, led to the \\ncountry’s dismemberment.\\n\\nWhat can we do, then, to restore the validity of \\ninternational agreements? There were warning signs \\nof current events in Ukraine earlier. Alarm bells rang \\nalready six years ago in Georgia, but few bothered to \\nhear the wake-up call. We must take, therefore, conflict \\nprevention more seriously. We must support States in \\ntheir choice of democracy, the rule of law and human \\nrights and decisions that follow from that. These recent \\ndevelopments force us seriously to reconsider the role \\nof the United Nations. How can one of the fundamental \\ngoals of the United Nations, global peace and security, \\nbe promoted when basic international agreements are \\nignored, State borders are changed, and territories are \\nannexed through force?\\n\\nWe cannot ignore that the Security Council has been \\nparalysed as international justice has been manipulated \\nand multiple crises have escalated. The Security Council \\nneeds to be reformed. Its work methods and principles \\nmust be revised, with special attention on the openness, \\naccountability and transparency of its processes. The \\npermanent members of the Security Council bear \\nenormous responsibility in guaranteeing international \\npeace. No permanent member should abuse the veto to \\ncircumvent the principles of the United Nations Charter.\\n\\nHuman rights remain the most cherished of values \\nof the United Nations. Unfortunately, respect for \\nhuman rights can still not be assumed to be the norm. \\nWe cannot accept arguments that for some countries \\nhuman rights do not apply for cultural reasons. Human \\nrights, as stated in the Universal Declaration, are \\nuniversal, inalienable and inviolable. They are based \\non the humanity and dignity of each and every person.\\n\\nNo peace or justice, stability or security can \\nbe guaranteed unless the basic rights of all human \\nbeings are respected and protected in every country \\nby all Governments. We must, moreover, pay special \\nattention to the rights of the most vulnerable groups. \\nWomen’s rights must be protected everywhere. It is \\ncrucial that empowering women and action against \\ngender-based violence be implemented in accordance \\nwith Security Council resolution 1325 (2000). We must \\nrespect the rights of children and minorities, as well as \\nthose of indigenous people. We must care for people \\nwith special needs.\\n\\nFree speech remains a crucial right. Some States \\nhave made efforts to stop the free flow of information \\non the Internet and to divide cyberspace along State \\nborders. This we must avoid. The Internet must remain \\na universal platform for the uninhibited exchange of \\ninformation. Estonia is proud to be a founding member \\nof the Freedom Online Coalition, a community of 23 \\nnations committed to promoting free speech online, and \\nthe multi-stakeholder model of a free and open Internet. \\nIt is a global initiative that brings together Governments, \\nnon-governmental organizations, entrepreneurs and \\nthink tanks.\\n\\nIn April, the Freedom Online Coalition gathered in \\nour capital and issued the Tallinn Agenda, a statement \\nexpressing our strongly shared conviction that all people \\nare entitled to the same rights and freedoms, online as \\nwell as offline. This is not a lifestyle question. The \\nInternet is a driver of economic growth and a key tool \\nfor development. Since the 1990s it has blossomed into a \\nglobal network of nearly three billion users. Most of the \\nnext billion Internet users will come from developing \\ncountries. The United Nations post-2015 development \\nagenda should recognize the importance of new \\ntechnologies and e-services as a major contribution to \\nthe security and prosperity of the world. As we grow \\nmore dependent on digital services in our daily lives, \\nwe become more vulnerable to cyberattacks. Cyber \\nsecurity is essential, not just for protecting rights, \\nbut also for economic prosperity. Cyberattacks can \\nparalyse crucial services or infrastructure. They can \\ncause enormous economic damage. Limiting access to, \\nor censoring the contents of the Internet, however, is \\nnot the answer to cyber insecurity.\\n\\n\\n\\nAchieving sustainable development is essential in \\norder to tackle some of the challenges we face. Even \\nin the current fragile security environment, we must \\ntake care of the future of the planet and work towards \\na world where everyone can live a dignified life, \\nfree from poverty, violence and exclusion. In today’s \\ninterdependent world, this is hard to achieve without \\npeace and stability.\\n\\nThe world today also faces the outbreak of a \\ndeadly virus. This is no longer a local concern of a \\nfew countries. Ebola has become an international \\npublic health emergency. Despite efforts already made \\nby Governments and international organizations the \\noutbreak races ahead. We support the efforts of the \\nGlobal Ebola Response Coalition tasked to contain and \\nstop the spread of the virus.\\n\\nClimate change is already an existential threat \\nto some countries. It has a dramatic impact on their \\nliving conditions and their security. The small island \\ndeveloping States are most vulnerable. If we do not act \\nsoon enough other countries will be threatened as well. \\nWe must see this problem globally, not just from the \\nperspective of short-term national or economic interest.\\n\\nThe risks of conflict, violence, insecurity, financial \\nand economic collapse, climate change, lack of resources \\nand natural disasters are inextricably intertwined and \\nneed to be addressed comprehensively. The new post-\\n2015 development agenda must be truly universal. \\nSustainable development goals are best addressed \\ntogether. Progress in these fields will be guaranteed by \\ngood governance, transparency of decision-making and \\nlow corruption. Effective and accountable institutions \\nare powerful enablers of sustainable development, and \\nmodern digital technology helps us to create them. In \\nEstonia, we have developed an e-governance system \\nthat increases transparency and limits corruption. \\nWe have been sharing the system with all interested \\npartners and we continue to be willing to do so.\\n\\nSince 8 May 1945, we have believed that we had \\nbeen freed of certain ideological demons for good. Yet \\ntoday we see the return of long-discredited ideas dating \\nback to 1938. The existence of co-ethnics abroad has \\nbeen used as a justification to annex territory. This is in \\n2014, not in 1938. So, too, we have seen a return to the \\nideologies of hatred, lies and propaganda. We must be \\nclear in condemning extreme nationalism, homophobia, \\nxenophobia and religious extremism. We need to recall \\nand reaffirm the values that the United Nations was \\ncreated to protect. The United Nations, a unique global \\ninstrument of security and peace, must succeed where \\nthe League of Nations once failed.\\n\\nLet us not forget that 75 years ago, on 23 August \\n1939, a pact was signed between Hitler’s Germany \\nand Stalin’s Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to \\ndivide Eastern Europe into their spheres of influence. \\nA week later, on 1 September, Hitler attacked Poland. \\nOn 17 September, two and a half weeks later, Hitler’s \\nerstwhile ally, the Soviet Union, also attacked Poland, \\nand the Second World War had begun.\\n\\nThe date of 31 August this year marked 20 years \\nsince the occupation forces left Estonia — troops that \\nwere there as a result of that same Stalin-Hitler pact. Yet \\njust a few days later on 5 September, an Estonian police \\nofficer was abducted by foreign security services on \\nEstonian territory and taken by force to Moscow, where \\nhe is still being held in the infamous Lefortovo prison.\\n\\nWe cannot allow anyone ever to divide countries \\ninto spheres of influence. The community of nations is \\nonly secure when its smallest members can feel secure. \\nWe cannot and will not accept threats and intimidation \\nin twenty-first century international relations. We \\ncannot have peace, security or prosperity in Europe, or \\nin the world, unless we again find a way to enforce and \\nrevalidate the agreements that we have all signed and \\nare parties to.\\n',\n",
       " 'When I addressed the Assembly last year (see A/69/PV.8), foremost on our minds was the state of European and global security. The blatant violation of international law in connection with the occupation of Ukrainian territory that we witnessed in the spring of 2014 triggered a profound change in the global security situation. A year later, we are still adapting to that altered, more unpredictable state of affairs. As we continue to tackle global challenges, including terrorism, climate change, poverty and human rights violations, the number of conflicts and crises worldwide continues to grow.\\nWe also witnessed a positive development recently. Let us hope that the historic agreement on Iran’s nuclear programme will pave the way for greater stability in the broader Middle East. It is a region where conflicts in Syria and Libya have led to the radicalization of an ever greater number of people and to the emergence of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). It poses a serious threat to peace and security in Syria, Iraq and the broader Middle East. ISIL violates universal human values. No country is immune to the threat that it poses. Stopping ISIL and other terrorist organizations requires a global effort. Estonia supports the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL, and we believe that the United Nations and the Global Counterterrorism Forum also have an important role to play there.\\nThe ongoing crises and conflicts, including in Syria and Libya, have also led to the current refugee crisis in Europe. While Europe’s refugee crisis has been in the international headlines in recent months, the problem itself is obviously wider and more global. According to United Nations statistics, one in every 122 persons is now either a refugee, an asylum seeker abroad or an\\ninternally displaced person in his or her home country. Worldwide, 42,000 people flee their homes every day. Never before have there been so many people forced to be on the move. The civil war in Syria alone has created more than 4 million refugees. The majority of them have sought refuge in neighbouring countries, which have borne by far the greatest burden. But many refugees have opted to take the dangerous route across the Mediterranean and have ended up in Europe. There were 600,000 asylum seekers in Europe in 2014, and there will be far more this year.\\nI am also extremely worried about the rising support that we are witnessing for far-right and far-left political movements in Europe, often fuelled by anti-immigrant, racist statements that threaten the liberal-democratic base of our continent that has allowed us to live in prosperity since the Second World War. Short-sighted populist policies exploiting the fears of ordinary people will lead nowhere.\\nThe European Union (EU) is the main donor in the effort to alleviate the Syrian refugee crisis. Approximately €4 billion has been mobilized by the European Commission and EU member States for humanitarian, development, economic and stabilization assistance to Syrian internally displaced persons and refugees. And more efforts are being planned, including an African trust fund. The aim is to shift the focus from dealing with the consequences of the migration crisis to dealing with its root causes. But this truly biblical movement of people demands a global response.\\nWe not only have the responsibility to bring peace and stability to Syria and Libya but also to put an end to the aggression against Ukraine. Compared to what it was a year ago, the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine is less intense, but daily fighting continues. Crimea remains illegally occupied. Those responsible for the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 are still at large. The attempts to obstruct justice on that matter are deeply disturbing. The long-standing protracted conflicts in Georgia, Moldova and Nagorno Karabakh remain unresolved. Dialogue and diplomatic efforts to find a solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict must continue. A solution to the conflict must, however, not come at the expense of the principles that underpin European and global security. We must continue to stand up for the international agreements that we have collectively agreed upon — the Charter of the United Nations, the Helsinki Final Act, the Charter of Paris for a New Europe — and demand that they be honoured\\n15-29437 15/26\\n\\x0c\\nA/70/PV.17 29/09/2015\\nand enforced. We must continue to stand up to attempts to divide countries and establish spheres of influence.\\nAs the number of conflicts and crises worldwide grows, respect for human rights has become more important than ever. We must uphold universal values and stop massive violations of human rights and crimes against humanity, regardless of who or what caused them. As stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, human rights apply to everyone without exception.\\nThis year marks the twentieth anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and the Platform of Action, which have influenced how we address equality and women’s rights today. We need to continuously stand for the rights of women and girls and strive for the elimination of gender-based violence. Women’s rights and the empowerment of women and girls must be promoted at all levels. I welcome the 2015 high-level review and global study on the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) and hope that it will provide us with a new impetus to move forward on those issues. We must advance global actions linked to the welfare of children by investing in their education and health, as well as by keeping them away from armed conflicts.\\nAn active and dynamic civil society is a precondition for prosperity. A free press, the freedom of speech and the freedom of conscience are the cornerstones of any open society. In an era of so-called multiple narratives, we must pay tribute to those activists, journalists and bloggers who risk their lives to expose the truth.\\nThis year, the Human Rights Council established a mandate on the right to privacy. Journalists, bloggers, human rights activists and many others living under authoritarian regimes have urged their Governments to stop the arbitrary or unlawful interference with their privacy. They have called on their Governments to stop taking over their emails, closing their blogs and applying censorship. Unfortunately, the situation concerning the right to privacy and the freedom of expression has worsened during the past several years. Governments must protect the right to privacy, as stated in articles 2, 17 and 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Any interference with privacy must be lawful and reasonable. At the same time, the right to the freedom of expression must be guaranteed. Estonia has high expectations with regard to the new mandate.\\nThis is a crucial year for global action against poverty and for promoting sustainable development.\\nI welcome the historic agreement reached on the Sustainable Development Goals in the form of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Action (resolution 70/1). National Governments can play a key role in creating an environment conducive to sustainable development. The promotion of peaceful and inclusive societies, the respect for human rights, gender equality, the rule of law and good governance, as well as environmental sustainability, are central to the new global partnership. Economic growth is, assuredly, important, but must not come at the expense of the environment. The twenty- first session of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held soon in Paris, should reach an agreement that promotes those goals.\\nThe smart use of the Internet and digital technologies can be essential drivers for economic growth and development. We need strong public policies so that the digital era can become a genuine success and a motor of development for each country and each member of society. That requires a stable, predictable legal environment that encourages foreign investment and competition. We also need an educational system that teaches the necessary new skills, and we need an accessible Internet and Internet freedom. Those are steps that only Governments can provide.\\nNinety per cent of the people without access to the Internet live in the developing world. Bridging the digital divide among and within countries — across borders, gender, income and age — is essential for a contemporary digital economy. In 2016, the Internet itself will become the world’s fifth-largest economy, behind only those of the United States, China, Japan and India. It is time for world leaders to place the potential of digital technologies at the top of the development agenda. I am personally glad to co-chair the advisory panel for the upcoming World Bank World Development Report 2016. That report, entitled “Digital Dividends”, examines how the Internet can be a force for development and asks, importantly, what is required to unlock the still largely unrealized potential of digital technologies.\\nAdherence to the principle of the rule of law is an essential cornerstone of peace and security. Estonia strongly supports the International Criminal Court (ICC) in its activities, including its quest to end impunity. We call on all countries that have not yet done so to join the Rome Statute of the ICC. We also urge all States parties to join in the ratification of the outcome documents of\\n16/26 15-29437\\n\\x0c\\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.17\\nthe Review Conference of the Rome Statute of the ICC. The responsibility to provide accountability is, first and foremost, a domestic task. It is therefore essential that States build their national capacities to investigate and prosecute serious international crimes. Estonia has provided development cooperation resources to assist countries in their national implementation of the Rome Statute, and we encourage other States parties to act in a similar manner.\\nUnder the first pillar of the responsibility to protect, all States Members of the United Nations commit to protect their people from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the responsibility to protect, I reiterate our support for that principle, and call on the international community to make a renewed commitment to prevent genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. The Security Council bears primary responsibility in that regard. Unfortunately, in the most serious situations, the Security Council has failed to act owing to the abuse of the veto. It is disappointing that in cases such as those of Syria and Ukraine, Council debates have brought no result. Council members must not vote against actions aimed at preventing and stopping mass atrocities. We therefore support the initiatives of the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency (ACT) group and of France and Mexico on the non-use of the veto in cases of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes or other atrocities.\\nSecurity Council reform clearly needs to become a reality. United Nations reform, which Estonia strongly supports, is not only about the Security Council. We see this seventieth anniversary of the United Nations as a good opportunity to make progress on reform. As a member of the ACT group, Estonia is eager to increase transparency in the process of the election of the next Secretary-General. I am glad that some ACT proposals have already contributed to making the process more transparent. For the first time in the history of the United Nations, an agreement has emerged to the effect that the election process, the lists of candidates and informal meetings should begin in a concrete way. I hope for close cooperation between the Presidents of the General Assembly and the Security Council to that end.\\nLet me stress the importance of taking responsibility. We are being assaulted by an avalanche of problems. It is especially important that we adhere to our values and\\nstand by our commitments. Only then will the concepts of human rights, equality, democracy and international law acquire meaning. Only if we uphold those values will we be able to surmount the turbulent times in which we find ourselves today.\\n',\n",
       " 'I bring greetings from Jerusalem, the city in which the Jewish people’s hopes and prayers for peace for all of humanity have echoed throughout the ages.\\nThirty-one years ago, as Israel’s Ambassador to the United Nations, I stood at this rostrum for the first time. I spoke that day against a draft resolution sponsored by Iran to expel Israel from the United Nations. Then, as now, the United Nations was obsessively hostile towards Israel, the one true democracy in the Middle East. Then, as now, some sought to deny the one and only Jewish State a place among nations. I ended that first speech by saying, “Gentlemen, check your fanaticism at the door” (A/39/PV.32, para. 83).\\nMore than three decades later, as the Prime Minister of Israel, I am again privileged to speak from this rostrum. And for me, that privilege has always come with a moral responsibility to speak the truth. So after three days of listening to world leaders praise the nuclear deal with Iran, I begin my speech today by saying, “Ladies and gentlemen, check your enthusiasm at the door”. The deal does not make peace more likely.\\nBy fuelling Iran’s aggressions with billions of dollars in sanctions relief, it makes war more likely.\\nJust look at what Iran has done in the past six months alone, since the framework agreement was announced in Lausanne. Iran boosted its supply of devastating weapons to Syria. Iran sent more soldiers of its Revolutionary Guard into Syria. Iran sent thousands of Afghani and Pakistani Shiite fighters to Syria. Iran did all that to prop up Al-Assad’s brutal regime. Iran also shipped tons of weapons and ammunition to the Houthi rebels in Yemen, including another shipment just two days ago. Iran threatened to topple Jordan. Iran’s proxy, Hizbullah, smuggled into Lebanon SA-22 missiles to down our planes and Yakhont cruise missiles to sink our ships. Iran supplied Hizbullah with precision-guided surface-to-surface missiles and attack drones so it can accurately hit any target in Israel. Iran aided Hamas and Islamic Jihad in building armed drones in Gaza. Iran also made clear its plans to open two new terror fronts against Israel, promising to arm Palestinians in the West Bank and sending its Revolutionary Guard generals to the Golan Heights, from which its operatives recently fired rockets on northern Israel.\\nIsrael will continue to respond forcefully to any attacks against it from Syria. Israel will continue to act to prevent the transfer of strategic weapons to Hizbullah from and through Syrian territory. Every few weeks, Iran and Hizbullah set up new terrorist cells in cities throughout the world. Three such cells were recently uncovered in Kuwait, Jordan and Cyprus. In May, security forces in Cyprus raided a Hizbullah agent’s apartment in the city of Larnaca. There they found five tons of ammonium nitrate — roughly the same amount of ammonium nitrate used to blow up the Federal Building in Oklahoma City. And that was just in one apartment, in one city, in one country. But Iran is setting up dozens of terrorist cells like that around the world. They are setting up those terror cells in this hemisphere as well.\\nI repeat, Iran has been doing all of this — everything that I have just described — just within the past six months, when it was trying to convince the world to remove the sanctions. Just imagine what Iran will do after those sanctions are lifted. Unleashed and unmuzzled, Iran will go on the prowl, devouring more and more prey. In the wake of the nuclear deal, Iran is spending billions of dollars on weapons and satellites. Does anyone here think that Iran is doing that to\\n15-29658 27/55\\n\\x0c\\nA/70/PV.22 01/10/2015\\nadvance peace? Does anyone here think that hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions relief and fat contracts will turn that rapacious tiger into a kitten? People who think so should think again.\\nIn 2013, President Rouhani began his so-called charm offensive here at the United Nations. Two years later, Iran is executing more political prisoners, escalating its regional aggression and rapidly expanding its global terror net. They say that actions speak louder than words, but, in Iran’s case, their words speak as loudly as their actions. Just listen to the Deputy Commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Qods Force. In February, he said that “the Islamic Revolution is not limited by geographic borders”. He boasted that Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine and Yemen are among the countries being “conquered by the Islamic Republic of Iran”. He said “conquered”.\\nFor those here who believe that the deal in Vienna will bring about a change in Iran’s policy, listen to what Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, said five days after the nuclear deal was reached: “Our policies towards the arrogant Government of the United States will not change”. The United States, he vowed, will continue to be Iran’s enemy. While giving the mullahs more money is likely to fuel more repression inside Iran, it will definitely fuel more aggression outside Iran.\\nAs the leader of a country defending itself every day against Iran’s growing aggression, I wish that I could take comfort in the claim that this deal blocks Iran’s path to nuclear weapons, but I cannot, because it does not. This deal does place several constraints on Iran’s nuclear programme, and rightly so, because the international community recognizes that Iran is particularly dangerous. But, here is the catch. Under this deal, if Iran does not change its behaviour — in fact, even if it becomes more dangerous in the years to come — the most important constraints will still be automatically lifted by year 10 and by year 15. That would place a militant Islamic terror regime weeks away from having the fissile material for an entire arsenal of nuclear bombs. That just does not make any sense.\\nI have said that if Iran wants to be treated like a normal country, let it act like a normal country. This deal will treat Iran like a normal country even if it remains a dark theocracy that conquers its neighbours, sponsors terrorism worldwide and chants, “Death to Israel, death to America!” Does anyone seriously\\nbelieve that flooding a radical theocracy with weapons and cash will curb its appetite for aggression? Does anyone here really believe that a theocratic Iran with sharper claws and sharper fangs will be more likely to change its stripes? There is a general rule that I have learned — and that that those here must have learned it in their lifetime — which is that when bad behaviour is rewarded, it only gets worse.\\nI have long said that the greatest danger that the world faces is the coupling of militant Islam with nuclear weapons. I am gravely concerned that the nuclear deal with Iran will prove to be the marriage certificate of that unholy union. I know that some well-intentioned people sincerely believe that this deal is the best way to block Iran’s path to the bomb. However, one of history’s most important, yet least learned lessons, is that the best intentions do not prevent the worst outcomes. The vast majority of Israelis believe that this nuclear deal with Iran is a very bad deal. What makes matters even worse is that we see the world celebrating this bad deal, rushing to embrace and do business with a regime that is openly committed to our destruction.\\nLast week, Major General Salehi, the Commander of Iran’s Army, proclaimed\\n“We will annihilate Israel, for sure. We are glad that we are in the forefront of executing the Supreme Leader’s order to destroy Israel.”\\nAs for the Supreme Leader himself, a few days after the nuclear deal was announced, he released his latest book. It is a 400-page screed detailing his plan to destroy the State of Israel. Last month, Khamenei once again made his genocidal intentions clear. Before Iran’s top clerical body, the Assembly of Experts, he spoke about Israel, which is home to over 6 million Jews. He pledged that “there will be no Israel in 25 years”. Seventy years after the murder of 6 million Jews, Iran’s rulers promise to destroy my country, murder my people, and the response from this body, the response from nearly every one of the Governments represented here, has been absolutely nothing — utter silence, deafening silence.\\nPerhaps members of the Assembly can now understand why Israel is not joining in the general celebration of the deal. If Iran’s rulers were working to destroy other members’ countries, perhaps they would be less enthusiastic about the deal. If Iran’s terror proxies were firing thousands of rockets at other members’ cities, perhaps they would be more measured in their praise. And if the deal were unleashing a nuclear\\n28/55 15-29658\\n\\x0c\\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22\\narms race in their neighbourhoods, perhaps they would be more reluctant to celebrate.\\nBut no one should think that Iran is a danger only to Israel. Besides Iran’s aggression in the Middle East and its terror campaign around the world, Iran is also building intercontinental ballistic missiles whose sole purpose is to carry nuclear warheads. Now this fact needs to be remembered: Iran already has missiles that can reach Israel. So those intercontinental ballistic missiles that Iran is building are not meant for us. They are meant for others — for Europe, for America, for raining down mass destruction anytime, anywhere.\\nIt is not easy to oppose something that is embraced by the greatest Powers in the world. Believe me, it would be far easier to remain silent. But throughout our history, the Jewish people have learned the heavy price of silence. And as the Prime Minister of the Jewish State, as someone who knows that history, I refuse to be silent. I will say it again. The days when the Jewish people remained passive in the face of genocidal enemies — those days are over. Not being passive means speaking up about those dangers. We have spoken up, we are speaking up, and we will continue to do so. Not being passive also means defending ourselves against those dangers. We have. We are. And we will.\\nIsrael will not allow Iran to break in, to sneak in or to walk into the nuclear-weapons club. I know that preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons remains the official policy of the international community. But no one should question Israel’s determination to defend itself against those who seek our destruction. For in every generation, there have been those who sought to destroy our people. In antiquity, we faced destruction from the ancient empires of Babylon and Rome. In the Middle Ages, we faced inquisitions and expulsions. And in modern times, we faced pogroms and the Holocaust. Yet the Jewish people persevered.\\nAnd now another regime has arisen, swearing to destroy Israel. That regime would be wise to consider this fact: I stand here today representing Israel, a country that is 67 years young but is the nation State of a people nearly 4,000 years old. The empires of Babylon and Rome are not represented in this Hall of nations, nor is the 1,000-year Reich. Those seemingly invincible empires are long gone. But Israel lives. The people of Israel live.\\nThe rebirth of Israel is a testament to the indomitable spirit of my people. For a hundred generations, the\\nJewish people dreamed of returning to the land of Israel. Even in our darkest hours — and we had so many — even in our darkest hours, we never gave up hope of rebuilding our eternal capital, Jerusalem. The establishment of Israel made it possible to realize that dream. It has enabled us to live as a free people in our ancestral homeland. It has enabled us to embrace Jews who have come from the four corners of the Earth to find refuge from persecution. They have come from war-torn Europe, from Yemen, Iraq, and Morocco, from Ethiopia and the Soviet Union, from a hundred other lands. And today, as a rising tide of anti-Semitism once again sweeps across Europe and elsewhere, many Jews come to Israel to join us in building the Jewish future.\\nSo here is my message to the rulers of Iran. Their plan to destroy Israel will fail. Israel will not permit any force on Earth to threaten its future. And here is my message to all the countries represented here. Whatever resolutions they may adopt in this building, whatever decisions they may take in their capitals, Israel will do whatever it must do to defend our State and to defend our people.\\nAs the deal with Iran moves ahead, I hope it will be enforced — how can I put this? — with a little more rigour than was shown with the six Security Council resolutions that Iran has systematically violated and which now have been effectively discarded. I would call for ensuring that the inspectors actually inspect, that the snapback sanctions actually snap back, and that Iran’s violations not be swept under the Persian rug. There is one thing I can assure the Assembly of today that Israel will be watching closely.\\nWhat the international community now needs to do is clear: first, it must make Iran comply with all its nuclear obligations, and hold Iran’s feet to the fire. Secondly, Iran’s regional aggression must be put in check by supporting and strengthening those fighting Iran’s aggression, beginning with Israel. Thirdly, use sanctions and all the tools available to tear down Iran’s global terror network.\\nIsrael is working closely with our Arab peace partners to address our common security challenges from Iran and also the security challenges from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and from others. We are also working with other States in the Middle East, as well as with countries in Africa, in Asia and beyond. Many in our region know that both Iran and ISIL are our common enemies. And when\\n15-29658 29/55\\n\\x0c\\nA/70/PV.22 01/10/2015\\none’s enemies fight each other, one does not strengthen either one. One weakens both.\\nCommon dangers are clearly bringing Israel and its Arab neighbours closer. As we work together to thwart the dangers that I have mentioned, I hope that we will build lasting partnerships for security, for prosperity and for peace. But in Israel, we never forget one thing. We never forget that Israel’s most important partner has always been, and will always be, the United States of America. The alliance between Israel and the United States is unshakeable.\\nPresident Obama and I agree on the need to keep arms out of the hands of Iran’s terror proxies. We agree on the need to stop Iran from destabilizing countries throughout the Middle East. Israel deeply appreciates President Obama’s willingness to bolster our security and to help Israel maintain its qualitative military edge in order to confront the enormous challenges we face. Israel is grateful that this sentiment is widely shared by the American people and its representatives in Congress — both by those who supported the deal and by those who opposed it.\\nPresident Obama and I have both said that our differences over the nuclear deal are a disagreement within the family. But we have no disagreement about the need to work together to secure our common future. And what a great future it could be. Israel is uniquely poised to take advantage of the promise of the twenty-first century. Israel is a world leader in science and technology, in cybertechnology, software, water, agriculture, medicine, biotechnology and so many other fields that are being revolutionized by Israeli ingenuity and Israeli innovation. Israel is the innovation nation. Israeli know-how is everywhere. It is in our computers’ microprocessors and flash drives. It is in our smart phones, when we send instant messages and navigate our cars. It is on our farms, when we drip-irrigate our crops and keep our grains and produce fresh. It is in our universities, when we study Nobel Prize-winning discoveries in chemistry and economics. It is in our medicine cabinets, when we use drugs to treat Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis. It is even on our plates, when we eat delicious cherry tomatoes. They were also perfected in Israel, in case someone did not know.\\nWe are so proud in Israel of the long strides that our country has been able to take in a short time. We are so proud that our small country is making such a huge contribution to the entire world. Yet the dreams of\\nour people, enshrined for eternity by the great prophets of the Bible, will be fully realized only when there is peace.\\nAs the Middle East descends into chaos, Israel’s peace agreements with Egypt and Jordan are two cornerstones of stability. Israel remains committed to achieving peace with the Palestinians as well. Israelis know the price of war. I know the price of war. I was nearly killed in battle. I lost many friends. I lost my beloved brother Yoni. Those who know the price of war can best appreciate what the blessings of peace would mean — for ourselves, our children and our grandchildren. I am prepared to immediately resume direct peace negotiations with the Palestinian Authority without any preconditions whatsoever. Unfortunately, President Abbas said yesterday that he is not prepared to do that. I hope he changes his mind, because I remain committed to a vision of two States for two peoples, in which a demilitarized Palestinian State recognizes the Jewish State.\\nAs members know, the peace process began over two decades ago. Yet despite the best efforts of six Israeli prime ministers — Rabin, Peres, Barak, Sharon, Olmert and myself — the Palestinians have consistently refused to end the conflict and to make a final peace with Israel. Unfortunately, we heard that rejectionism again only yesterday from President Abbas. How can Israel make peace with a Palestinian partner who refuses to even sit at the negotiating table? Israel expects the Palestinian Authority to abide by its commitments. The Palestinians should not walk away from peace. I would like to tell President Abbas that I know it is not easy. I know it is hard. But we owe it to our peoples to try, to continue to try. If we actually sit down together, if we actually negotiate and stop negotiating about the negotiation, and if we actually sit down to try to resolve the conflict between us, recognizing each other and not using a Palestinian State as a stepping stone for yet another Islamist dictatorship in the Middle East but as something that will live at peace next to the Jewish State, we can do remarkable things for our peoples.\\nThe United Nations can help advance peace by supporting direct, unconditional negotiations between the parties. The United Nations will certainly not help advance peace by trying to impose solutions or by encouraging Palestinian rejectionism, And the United Nations should do one more thing. The United Nations should finally rid itself of its obsessive bashing of Israel. Here is just one absurd example of\\n30/55 15-29658\\n\\x0c\\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22\\nthat obsession. In the four years of horrific violence in Syria, more than a quarter of a million people have lost their lives. That is more than 10 times the number of Israelis and Palestinians combined who have lost their lives in a century of conflict between us. Yet last year, the Assembly adopted 20 resolutions against Israel and only one resolution about the savage slaughter in Syria. Talk about injustice. Talk about disproportionality. Count them: 20. And one against Syria. Well, frankly I am not surprised. To borrow a line from Yogi Berra, the late, great baseball player and part-time philosopher, when it comes to the annual bashing of Israel at the United Nations, it is déjà vu all over again.\\nEnough is enough. Today, 31 years after I stood here for the first time, I am still asking when the United Nations will finally check its anti-Israel fanaticism at the door, when the United Nations will finally stop slandering Israel as a threat to peace and when it will actually start helping Israel advance peace. The same question should be posed to Palestinian leaders. When will they start working with Israel to advance peace and reconciliation, stop libelling Israel and stop inciting hatred and violence?\\nHere is a good place for President Abbas to begin. He should stop spreading lies about Israel’s alleged intentions on the Temple Mount. Israel is fully committed to maintaining the status quo there. What President Abbas should be speaking out against are the actions of the militant Islamists who are smuggling explosives into the Al-Aqsa Mosque and who are trying to prevent Jews and Christians from visiting the holy sites. That is the real threat to those sacred sites.\\nA thousand years before the birth of Christianity, more than 1,500 years before the birth of Islam, King David made Jerusalem our capital, and King Solomon built the Temple on that Mount. Yet Israel will always respect the sacred shrines of all religions. In a region plagued by violence and by unimaginable intolerance, in which Islamic fanatics are destroying the ancient treasures of civilization, Israel stands out as a towering beacon of enlightenment and tolerance. Far from endangering the holy sites, Israel ensures their safety. Because, unlike the Powers that ruled Jerusalem in the past, Israel respects the holy sites and the freedom of worship of Jews, Muslims, Christians — everyone. And that will never change.\\nBecause Israel will always stay true to its values. Those values are on display each and every day. They are on display when Israel’s feisty parliament\\nvigorously debates every issue under the sun; when Israel’s Chief Justice sits in her chair at our fiercely independent Supreme Court; when our Christian community continues to grow and thrive from year to year, whereas Christian communities elsewhere in the Middle East are decimated; when a brilliant young Israeli Muslim student gives her valedictorian address at one of our finest universities; and when Israeli doctors and nurses — doctors and nurses from the Israeli military — treat thousands of wounded from the killing fields of Syria and thousands more in the wake of natural disasters from Haiti to Nepal. That is the true face of Israel. Those are the values of Israel.\\nIn the Middle East, those values are under savage assault by militant Islamists, who are forcing millions of terrified people to flee to distant shores. Just 10 miles from ISIS and a few hundred yards from Iran’s murderous proxies, Israel stands in the breach, proudly and courageously defending freedom and progress. Israel is civilization’s front line in the battle against barbarism. So here is a novel idea for the United Nations. Instead of continuing the shameful routine of bashing Israel, the international community should stand with Israel. The international community should stand with Israel as we work to check the fanaticism at its doors. It should stand with Israel as we prevent that fanaticism from even reaching its doors. The international community should stand with Israel because Israel is not just defending itself. More than ever, Israel is defending the world!\\n',\n",
       " 'The seventieth anniversary of the United Nations offers us an opportunity to renew our commitments to the ideals and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Today, those ideals and principles are threatened in so many ways around the globe. We are witnessing the largest displacement of people since the Second World War. As of last year, nearly 60 million people were displaced by war, conflict or persecution. Violent extremism is on the rise, with terrorist groups demonstrating new levels of brutality and barbarity. In the twenty-first century, women and girls are sold in slave markets by the criminals of Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS) and abused in unspeakable ways. We have entered an era where the most primitive and brutal executions coexist with the most sophisticated information warfare, hybrid warfare and cyberwarfare.\\nThe Charter of the United Nations has been breached in the middle of Europe, with no consequences. Last year, Russia annexed Crimea, and the Kremlin seeks to rewrite history and redraw the borders of post-war Europe. Even in the context of the multiple crises and security challenges the world is facing today,\\nthe annexation of Crimea and military aggression in eastern Ukraine stand out because of their implications for the future of international peace and security. These acts strike at the very core of international law and at universally accepted norms of behaviour that have allowed the world community to survive without world wars for seven decades.\\nWe cannot pledge respect for the Charter of the United Nations and ignore its breaches at the same time. Our collective failure to stand up for the underlying principles of the independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine will have far-reaching negative repercussions for international order. The occupied territories of Ukraine, Georgia or Moldova are full of red lines that we ourselves have drawn but never acted upon. Again, we are reminded that if one closes one’s eyes to crimes, they do not disappear. They spread, grow and finally they take over. That is why it is our duty to uphold international humanitarian and human rights laws and to seek accountability when these laws are violated. Vetoing a Security Council resolution to commemorate the Srebrenica massacre or to set up a tribunal for the downing of Flight MH-17 is unjustifiable and is an insult to the memory of the victims. It also raises questions about the relevance, in the twenty-first century, of the Security Council as it is today.\\nFor the Council to maintain its credibility, the least it can do is put an end to the use of the veto in cases of genocide, atrocity crimes, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Where would we be today had the Council been able to secure proper humanitarian access in Syria, had it taken measures to stop the use of barrel bombs and ensure accountability for gross human rights violations and abuses? The Security Council failed to do so, and millions of Syrians had to flee. By protecting the criminals, the four vetoes of resolutions pertaining to Syria did nothing to resolve the situation.\\nAs a result, today we have the largest humanitarian crisis in the world. It is a global crisis that requires a global response. Unless we address the causes that make people flee their homes — such as lawlessness, repression and grave human rights abuses, corruption and poor governance, massive inequalities and marginalization — these flows of refugees will not stop. Conflicts will continue. Lawlessness breeds the worst of the worst — extremism, radicals and terrorists. We simply cannot afford for this to happen.\\n20/26 15-29437\\n\\x0c\\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.17\\nWe live in an era when challenges and threats are enhanced by new ones. At 70, the United Nations must adapt to the realities of the twenty-first century and have the tools necessary to operate. The United Nations must do much better, tackling the underlying causes of the problems and conflicts at hand, and not merely the symptoms. It must be equipped and staffed to operate in environments of asymmetric and hybrid warfare, information wars and the growing threat of terrorism. It must also do a lot better at prevention and mediation, in order to save lives, as well as resources.\\nIn the twenty-first century the world will need a strong United Nations that has been renewed in every sphere. Either we act now and shape globalization through cooperation and partnership, or the crises and conflicts of the globalized world will force us to respond at a much greater cost to all of us. The United Nations will cease to exist if people stop believing in it. Through our activities, 70 years after the founding of the United Nations, we must show that we continue to believe firmly in this Organization, which we all share.\\n',\n",
       " 'As we celebrate 70 years of the United Nations and 70 years since the end of the Second World War, it is time for us all to take stock. What has been achieved? Where have we failed? What is there yet to do to create a safer and better world?\\nIn July, we marked the seventy-fifth anniversary since the Sumner Welles Declaration on the non-recognition policy of the illegal Soviet annexation of the Baltic States. This policy reflected the principle, based on international law, that the change of borders by force is not acceptable. The firm stance of the international\\ncommunity in support of this principle has been of great importance to us.\\nSince its completion in San Francisco in 1945, the Charter of the United Nations has embodied the core principles of the international system. However, far too often international order and principles have been violated and the United Nations has been unable to prevent conflicts or build peace or stop atrocities. Past failures must be lessons for the future. The United Nations, and in particular the Security Council, must be able to implement the mission set by the Charter with a renewed sense of responsibility.\\nIt is time to move forward with Security Council reform. We applaud efforts to revive negotiations on this important issue. Latvia supports the expansion of the Security Council in both categories of membership. At least one additional non-permanent seat should be ensured for the Eastern European States. Early action of the United Nations in situations of concern is crucial. Latvia supports the proposal to voluntarily restrain the use of the veto in the Security Council in situations involving mass atrocity crimes. It also supports, for all members of the Council, adherence to a code of conduct that would suspend their right to veto any action designed to end and prevent mass atrocity crimes.\\nOn several crucial occasions in recent times, the Security Council was not able to take timely and decisive action. That has had dire consequences. The Security Council was blocked from playing a role in stopping Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and in seeking justice for the victims of the Flight MH-17 in\\n\\nan international tribunal that could establish the truth on who shot down that civilian aeroplane. The conflict in eastern Ukraine has cost thousands of lives and led to the suffering of millions of innocent victims. Russia must stop all forms of support to separatists and use its influence to make them adhere to the Minsk agreements. Full implementation of the Minsk agreements by all parties is essential.\\nThe international community, including the General Assembly, supports Ukraine and its territorial integrity. The illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol by Russia will not be recognized. We are particularly concerned about the worsening social, economic and human rights situation in Crimea, especially affecting Crimean Tatars and ethnic Ukrainians. Together with the rest of the international community, Latvia will continue to support Ukraine’s reform process in order to strengthen its democracy, economy and good governance.\\nThe horrific conflict in Syria has entered its fifth year. It has created a humanitarian catastrophe and destabilized the whole region. The international community must not abandon the people of Syria and must push for a political settlement. Those responsible for using internationally prohibited chemical weapons in Syria must be identified and held accountable. The conflict and fragility of Syria and Iraq have contributed to the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant/ Daesh and the violent extremism spreading globally. Concerted international action is vital to defeat this evil and is key to achieving lasting peace and stability in Syria, Iraq and the wider region.\\nLatvia welcomes the recent nuclear agreement with Iran. The full and smooth implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Action Plan is now necessary. Only then can a change in the regional dynamics towards more engagement and cooperation, as well as greater stability in the Middle East region, become a reality.\\nIt is commendable that, despite all the existing challenges, the Government of Afghanistan has shown its commitment to the democratic process. Sustainable peace and stability in the country can be achieved only with continued strong commitment from the Afghan side and further international support.\\nThe resolution of protracted conflicts in Transnistria, Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Nagorno Karabakh should remain on the international agenda.\\nIncreased migration from conflict-torn Middle East and African countries to Europe has become one of the greatest humanitarian challenges of our time. Migration challenges also persist in the Asia-Pacific region and in the Americas. Beyond immediate humanitarian responses, the new trends of migration and forced displacement require long-term, comprehensive solutions. The stabilization of political, economic and social situations in the European Union’s neighbourhoods must be the ultimate goal. At the same time, a greater focus should be put on addressing the root causes of increased illegal migration, including by strengthening conflict prevention capabilities.\\nLatvia welcomes the ongoing United Nations review of peacekeeping. Cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations is essential to effectively fulfil peacekeeping mandates. Operational tasks need to be effectively synchronized between all involved parties. The European Union is an important partner of the United Nations, as demonstrated in the Central African Republic, Mali and other places. Latvia provides a voluntary contribution to United Nations peacekeeping and intends, for the first time, to participate in a United Nations peacekeeping mission.\\nInternational commitment to protect populations from atrocity crimes has been greatly strengthened in the past 10 years. Latvia strongly supports the work of the International Criminal Court as the legal arm of the responsibility to protect and hopes for swift activation of the Kampala amendments to the Rome Statute on the crime of aggression.\\nThis year the international community will conclude two of the most important international processes of our times. We have just adopted the ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) for the next 15 years. The Sustainable Development Goals must drive us to make real changes to end poverty and build prosperity and equality for all. With well-thought-out, focused and action-oriented policies we can do it. But most importantly, the involvement and accountability of all stakeholders at all levels will be critical to the success of the Sustainable Development Goals.\\nThese Goals will be greatly reinforced by the approval of a new universal agreement to address climate change at the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Paris. Failure to undertake ambitious mitigation actions cannot be accepted. Any\\n2/33 15-29568\\n\\x0c\\n30/09/2015 A/70/PV.20\\nfurther postponement will make adaptation extremely costly or even unfeasible. Latvia supports the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. It is also important to send a strong signal to investors and business of the plans to move towards a low-carbon, climate-resilient world.\\nThe United Nations has played a crucial role in advancing economic and social development and human rights for everyone. These ideals and values have proven to be timeless and universal. The United Nations will continue to be an important forum in the quest for solutions to future challenges through global discussion, raising awareness, creating expertise and building trust. At the forefront of these issues is the speed at which technology is evolving. Technological development is a source of progress and growth. At the same time, the rapid advancement of technology has exposed significant vulnerabilities and a variety of issues of transnational and cross-sectoral nature.\\nNations are facing an increasing challenge in countering cyberthreats. Efforts to prevent the misuse of new technologies, either by State or non-State actors, should be cooperative, international and cross- sectoral and involve all stakeholders. This will not be an easy process. We need to safeguard the right balance between fostering freedom of expression and open innovation on the Internet and ensuring that legitimate national security concerns are taken into account. This year, the General Assembly will review the results of the implementation of the World Summit on the Information Society over the past 10 years. It is important that this review process, in which Latvia is playing a leading role, be successful and contribute to the achievement of the overall United Nations goals set forth in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\\nNext year, we shall have to choose the next Secretary-General. It is important that the selection process be transparent and inclusive. Furthermore, it is high time for the Eastern European Group of States to provide the best possible candidate for the post of the next Secretary-General. It is the only regional group that has never been represented in this position.\\nThe people of our nations want to live in a safe, stable and prosperous world where conflicts, hunger and inequalities do not exist. In order to succeed in the task of implementing the new development Agenda, we all have the obligation to work to make the world a better place. Our responsibility is to ensure that the\\nroad ahead is built on the goals that were laid down in the Charter 70 years ago and which remain valid today and in the future.\\n',\n",
       " 'During the past 70 years we, the States Members of the United Nations, have been driven by the noble ideals and aspirations that the visionary founders of the United Nations laid down in its Charter in 1945. At the same time, we have been regularly confronted with the grim realities of international affairs. Over its history, the United Nations, both as an intergovernmental Organization and as an actor on the world stage, has been tested by numerous conflicts, humanitarian crises and immense\\n34/55 15-29658\\n\\x0c\\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22\\npolitical and economic changes in the world, as well as by a lack of financial stability.\\nThroughout all those years, the United Nations has played a crucial role in preventing global conflicts and has carried out vital work around the world in its service to humankind. From the outset, the United Nations has made major contributions to furthering the development and codification of international law as a way of regulating international relations. We should take a step back to see how far we have come and how far we need to go in meeting the challenges that exist across the three pillars of the Organization’s work: peace and security, development and human rights. New and acute challenges to the multilateral system and new threats to peace and security that transcend national borders have, unfortunately, emerged. Each and everyone is concerned by the threats of pandemics, climate change, migration, cybersecurity, and the multifaceted and violent nature of terrorism, including organized crime. There are no exceptions.\\nThe United Nations is the right place where all those threats should be addressed and eventually solved. I am deeply convinced that the United Nations remains strategically positioned to provide leadership and effective multilateral responses. A strong and effective United Nations means a better world, a more caring and accepting world, where nations and peoples of different religions, cultures and history can live together in peace — a world where right is might, not might makes right. I believe that strengthening the United Nations is the best investment for achieving the universal desire for peace, development, equality and justice in the world.\\nWe should collectively seek practical means that will enable the current system to live up to its original purposes. That will enable the United Nations to meet the weighty demands that are being and will be made upon it today, tomorrow and in many years to come. The Member States are the owners of the United Nations. Every country — big or small, from North or South, landlocked or insular — has an important individual responsibility and role to play as a driver of the necessary change. My Government has always had strong confidence in the United Nations and remains ready to fully shoulder its responsibility and commitments in that regard.\\nThe scale of global development challenges is unprecedented. A couple of days ago, in this very place we adopted the historic document defining the\\nSustainable Development Goals, “Transforming Our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” (resolution 70/1). We may call it a programme for a better planet, but it is not about the numbers, but about changing our mindsets. It is setting up the new philosophy of existence in a sustainable future. Its cornerstone is full inclusivity and zero disparity.\\nThe global security environment has never been as dynamic and uncertain as today. The number of major civil wars has almost tripled. The number of conflict casualties has skyrocketed. The most worrisome fact is the increased number of civilian casualties, including women and children. The United Nations works to maintain international peace and security in a world where security threats are becoming more complex and asymmetric, and conflicts more intractable and less conducive to traditional political settlements. The current pattern of violence also has serious implications for the implementation of mandates to protect civilians in the field. The United Nations has increasingly come under attack in areas where it has been present. Naturally, in such conditions, the level and the main priorities for United Nations involvement are being re-evaluated in a process of strategic reflection.\\nA secondary effect is the dramatic increase in the number of refugees. The World Bank estimates that roughly one fifth of the world’s population is affected by some form of violence or insecurity. The total number of people forcibly displaced by war, conflict and persecution rose to roughly 60 million by the end of 2014. On a daily basis, we are confronted with gruesome images in the news or directly in our streets, squares and transportation hubs. Forced displacement has, sadly, become a deliberate and widespread tactic, meaning that displacement is not only a short- term humanitarian problem, but also a long-term development and State-building issue.\\nThe current migration crisis is one of the most complex challenges, one that we have to face up front and address together. It affects all of us — the countries of origin, transit and destination. It therefore requires joint responses. Both immediate and long- term measures are absolutely necessary to address those challenges, which include illegal migration, the smuggling of and trafficking in human beings, and gross human rights violations.\\nWe must offer our assistance to those in need and prevent further tragedies involving refugees. For that to happen, we need systematic and comprehensive action\\n15-29658 35/55\\n\\x0c\\nA/70/PV.22 01/10/2015\\nand close cooperation on the part of countries, both of origin and of destination, that will bring a long-term sustainable solution. We must address the root causes of migration, namely, conflicts, intolerance, violence, poverty and a lack of the conditions needed for a decent life, just to mention a few.\\nAs acknowledged many times before, the irreplaceable nature of the Organization is most marked in peacekeeping. The past two decades have significantly tested the concept and conduct of United Nations peacekeeping operations. Slovakia has been an active contributor and stands ready to continue its cooperation with the United Nations in that field.\\nI was particularly pleased to see that both review panels — the High-level Independent Panel on United Nations Peace Operations and that of the Advisory Group of Experts on the 2015 Review of the Peacebuilding Architecture — have put strong emphasis on enhanced conflict prevention, diplomatic engagement and mediation support in the work of the United Nations system. Speaking from my personal experience as a mediator in South-Eastern Europe, I cannot but support the importance and high relevance of preventive diplomacy across the conflict spectrum and as a part of broader, nationally owned strategies to promote sustainable peace and development. The culture of conflict prevention and the conflict-resolution approaches that are now taking root in the United Nations system must be further developed, alongside more effective peacekeeping and peacebuilding.\\nIt has been 15 years since the adoption of the landmark Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and security. Yet the impacts of conflicts on women and children are still inordinate, and their engagement in peace processes is still insufficient. Gender equality is a natural precondition for sustainable development, stability and peace. As former Secretary-General Kofi Annan said,\\n“When women thrive, all of society benefits, and succeeding generations are given a better start in life.”\\nThe presence of women negotiators in high-profile United Nations peace and mediation processes, the role of women deployed by the United Nations to major conflict zones and high-stake inter-State negotiations, as well as in peacekeeping and peacebuilding in general, is irreplaceable and should continue to grow.\\nInternational terrorism in its most violent forms is an increasingly alarming threat to global peace and security, and those forms have become more diverse and fragmented in recent years. Slovakia strongly condemns all terrorist acts as criminal and unjustifiable. No terrorist act should be left without an adequate response from the international community. No perpetrator should be left unpunished and no movement affiliated with any form of terrorism should be tolerated.\\nThe United Nations has done much to set standards in the fight against international terrorism and to encourage and help Member States to meet them. The tenth anniversary of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy in 2016 will provide us with an opportunity to make our efforts in this struggle more efficient. It should be carried out in a multilateral and coordinated manner, with full respect for human rights and the rule of law. We should also redouble our efforts to conclude a comprehensive convention on international terrorism. Last but not least, Member States must strengthen their prevention efforts by working directly with affected communities to counter the violent extremism and radicalization that lead to terrorism. If we want to tackle this threat, we need to confront extremism in all its forms, violent and non-violent. Hate has never been the way to achieve a better future for anyone.\\nWe are now fewer than 60 days away from the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Paris, where the international community will discuss a new international climate change agreement. The impact of climate change is visible and undeniable throughout the world. Extreme droughts, melting of polar ice, substantive changes in long-term climate patterns and the rise in sea levels are the most glaring examples. As a result, Slovakia is committed to adopting at the United Nations climate conference this December a global binding climate agreement that will accelerate the shift towards societies and economies that are low-carbon and climate-resilient worldwide.\\n36/55 15-29658\\n\\x0c\\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22\\nThere are various internal and external forces that could drive any organization to change. Terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, poverty, disease, disparities causing socioeconomic tensions resulting in migration — all these challenges pose vital threats to humankind, and the only difference is how quickly the catastrophe strikes. The logical questions therefore relate to how ready we are to effectively react to challenges of the twenty-first century and whether we can draw useful lessons from the response to Ebola as an international health security threat.\\nContinuous management reform, optimal use of modern technologies, and gradual improvement of methods and structures for work that takes into account changes in the world are crucial if an organization wants to stay relevant. This is especially true for the United Nations. The seventieth anniversary of the Organization is viewed by many as a timely moment for achieving tangible progress. We need to address all existential challenges with the same attention. Act as one. Struggle as one. Deliver as one. One planet, one humankind, one destiny.\\nLet our work here at the United Nations be as real, practical and focused as possible so that we can deliver good results in the spirit of cooperation and compromise. The key desired result should be a strengthened and more effective, streamlined and responsive United Nations — a truly global organization that is better able to address interconnected and multidimensional threats and challenges to international peace, security and development.\\nI would like to conclude by quoting Norman Cousins, an American political journalist and professor, who received the United Nations Peace Medal in 1971:\\n“If the United Nations is to survive, those who represent it must bolster it; those who advocate it must submit to it; and those who believe in it must fight for it.”\\nThe current General Assembly session will be a new test of our commitment and ability to join forces in the pursuit of common goals. I am confident that under the leadership of President Lykketoft, we will be able to achieve the desired outcome.\\n',\n",
       " 'I address the General Assembly today for my tenth and last time. The first time I spoke here (see A/62/PV.5), I addressed climate change, conflict, refugees and — what was apparently a first at the General Assembly — cyberattacks as the continuation of policy by other means.\\nThe issues are therefore largely the same, and only the urgency that we sense has been ratcheted up. Certainly, the world was more stable then. It was before the economic and migration crises, the current conflicts in the wider Middle East, or Russia’s aggression against Georgia and Ukraine. It was also before the war on truth and facts that seems to have taken over in many places. Despite our concerns at the time, we lived in a more stable world, where optimism had not yet become naiveté. Today, in too many parts of the world, we find a conflict either emerging, raging or frozen. Terrorism, always a scourge, dominates our daily headlines in all parts of the world.\\nNot all of today’s conflicts and crises could have been prevented, yet the effect of many could have been mitigated had we acted sooner or had the proper mechanisms to resolve them been in place. When I addressed the Assembly in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Georgia in 2008 (see A/63/PV.8), I warned not to apply international law selectively. International law had clearly been violated, yet little was done. Six years later, in 2014, we saw a repeat performance in Ukraine. Part of a sovereign State was annexed and another part turned into a war zone. For the first time since the Second World War, borders in Europe had been changed through the use of force. The prohibition on the use of force to change borders lies at the heart of the Charter of the United Nations. It was blatantly violated, and yet the United Nations could not make a difference. Russia’s aggression in Ukraine continues. The territories of Ukraine and Georgia remain occupied by a foreign military force, and frozen conflicts persist in Nagorno Karabakh and Transnistria.\\nWe need global norms. Just as we need international law, we also need the mechanisms to enforce it. Unless the United Nations starts to do more, it will, over time, lose relevance. When we face a global challenge, the United Nations should be the first place to come to for a solution, not the last stop when all other options have been exhausted, knowing that nothing will happen anyway.\\nDuring the past 15 years, the number of migrants and refugees worldwide has grown faster than the world’s population. I raise the issue not only because it is a crisis, but also because I myself am a child of refugees. What we face is not — I stress — an unprecedented crisis, as so many have averred. We have faced far worse refugee crises and we have prevailed. In the Europe of 1946, Germany alone had 12 million internal refugees and another 12 million displaced persons of 20 different nationalities. Other countries in the post- war shambles and ruin of Europe at the time were not in much better shape. Yet we prevailed, or rather our grandparents did. In three years, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration — and I stress the first two words of the name of this agency — spent in today’s money approximately €50 billion to resolve that crisis. It took political will, courage and far more money to solve that crisis than we are willing to spend today.\\nMigration is our common challenge. A sustainable solution to this complex problem lies in addressing its causes. Yet we also must fulfil our commitments under international conventions on the protection of refugees. Such commitments already exist. They are not some vague future goal to which we pledge.\\nMigrant children are at the heart of migration influx. Children on the move or otherwise affected by migration are the most vulnerable group, who, lacking agency, face limited access to justice and social and health services and therefore often suffer horrible abuse. One significant challenge is to provide education to the children in refugee camps. Depriving them of education will damage the prospects of refugee and asylum-seeking children, leave them behind and, at the same time, increase the risk of the kind of alienation that often leads later to extremism. We have seen this where refugee camps have been in place for a long time — sometimes for generations — begetting a continuing crop of disaffected, alienated and radicalized youth who feel that they have nothing to lose.\\nThe ongoing conflicts we see around the world will, if we do not take control, breed a terrorism that knows no bounds. Estonia reaffirms its commitment to working together to prevent and counter terrorism, which is why we participate in the Global Coalition to Counter the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant.\\nEstonia firmly supports the International Criminal Court and its quest to end impunity. Countries, whether or not they have joined the Rome Statute, must set an example of non-aggression, self-restraint and respect for the rule of law. We believe that a commitment to fighting impunity at all levels is the only way to deter those who might commit crimes in future.\\nIn 2005, the States Members of the United Nations committed to the principle of responsibility to protect, better known as R2P, and to fight genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. However, the brutality we see in Syria shows that an effective solution lies beyond the grasp of the United Nations. When a Government fails to live up to its commitments, when it violates the fundamental norms of civilized behaviour — let alone the tenets of the United Nations — the international community must act. In this respect, the Security Council bears primary responsibility. Council members that veto or vote against actions aimed at preventing mass atrocities carry co-responsibility for those atrocities.\\nA primary criticism directed at the United Nations today is the Security Council’s inability or unwillingness to respond to major crises. Estonia cannot speak from first-hand experience, as we have not yet served in the Council; we have merely observed. We want, however, to bring the spirit of openness, transparency and inclusiveness to the Council’s work, and hence are running for a non-permanent seat for 2020-2021. We are convinced that the role of the General Assembly and the non-permanent members of the Council must be increased.\\nThe majority of States Members of the United Nations are small countries. As we look at the history of conflict since the Second World War, small countries are almost invariably the victims of conflict, not the abetters. This is nothing new. In the Melian Dialogue at the heart of his History of the Peloponnesian Wars, Thucydides famously concluded that “the strong do what they will, the weak suffer what they must”. That is why we have international law — to protect the weak and the small. Their voices must be better heard and their rights must be upheld. Estonia, as a member of the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency Group, is working together with a number of other countries to improve the working methods of the Security Council so as to bring about badly needed changes.\\nThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development are effective tools for advancing security and stability, spurring economic growth, eradicating poverty, preserving the environment and promoting human development. Taking that commitment seriously, Estonia was among the first countries to present our voluntary national review on the implementation of SDGs during the High-level Political Forum.\\nEstonia attaches great importance to the Goal of achieving gender equality that can unlock the economic potential of women. More equal societies work better for everyone. Achieving gender equality is first and foremost the duty of political leaders and the Governments that they lead. Amid current conflicts, it is important to ensure that women do not fall victim to gender-based violence. It is also important that they be included in conflict resolution and peace negotiations. It is therefore imperative to continue to implement Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) and related resolutions on women and peace and security.\\nFree media is an integral, even inseparable, part of modern and democratic society, where Governments listen to criticism, which, after all, forms part of what we call the voice of the people. Yet all around the globe, we see that critical voices — and even those that merely report the facts — face reprisals, jail and violence. The United Nations Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists and the Issue of Impunity must be implemented if we are to change the absurdity that reporting facts is a life-threatening activity.\\nFor Estonia, a leader of innovation in the digital world, the right to freedom of opinion and expression online and offline is a fundamental issue. Digital technology has been a liberating force, yet some would turn it into a means to control citizens. As a founder of the Freedom Online Coalition, Estonia is a donor to the Digital Defenders Partnership, contributing to the protection of the rights of journalists, bloggers and human-rights defenders online. In times of rapid developments in information and communications technology, the protection of human rights and the rule of law must keep pace.\\nThe right to freedom of expression also means keeping the Internet free and unrestricted. In other words, digital freedom of expression in no way differs from freedom of expression in the analog world. Censorship, illicit filtering and the online blocking of opposition voices thwarts democracy no less than when the printed word is censored.\\nAn open Internet is an amplifier of economic growth and thus a crucial element of sustainable development in the twenty-first century. That is an essential conclusion, incidentally, of the World Bank’s World Development Report 2016, entitled “Digital Dividends”, whose preparation I co-chaired. Information technology can lead to transparent governance and economic growth but only if it is open and unfettered.\\nThe challenges we face in the coming years are enormous. Estonia firmly believes in a rules-based international order. The only international organization global enough to achieve that end is the United Nations.\\nFinally, let me say that the 10 times I have appeared here over the past decade have been genuinely rewarding experiences, and I trust that my successor will continue to believe in the work that the Assembly does. I would like to thank the members for their attention and for all that they have given me.\\n',\n",
       " 'It is a great honour for me to address the General Assembly for the first time and to do so as Prime Minister of a country that has always been a proud and proactive member at the very heart of the United Nations.\\nThe United Nations was formed because leaders across the world knew that they could deliver security for their citizens at home only if they could cooperate as a community of nations to deliver security across the globe. Some of the threats that we face together today are familiar to those founding leaders: war, political instability, abuses of human rights and poverty. Others are new: global terrorism, climate change and unprecedented mass movements of people.\\nWe gather here today because we know that such challenges do not respect the borders of our individual nations and that only by working together shall we overcome them. As a new Prime Minister to the United Kingdom, my pledge to the United Nations is simple. The United Kingdom will be a confident, strong and dependable partner internationally, true to the universal values that we share together. We will continue to honour our commitment to spend 0.7 of our gross national income on development, building on the achievements that we have already made to reduce poverty, deal with instability and increase prosperity the world over, and we will drive forward the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.\\nWe will continue to champion the rights of women and girls, making sure that all girls get the education they deserve and tackling horrific abuses such as female genital mutilation and the use of sexual violence in conflict. We will continue to be a steadfast permanent member of the Security Council, meeting our NATO commitment to spend 2 per cent of gross domestic product on defence and making a leading contribution to United Nations peacekeeping efforts, where we have doubled our commitment, including new deployments to Somalia and South Sudan.\\nWe will continue to stand up for the rules-based international system and for international law, and I join other leaders in condemning the outrageous bombing of the aid convoy in Syria yesterday. We will continue to play our part in the international effort against climate change, and, in a demonstration of our commitment to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the United Kingdom will start its domestic procedures to enable ratification of the Paris Agreement and complete these before the end of the year. And we will continue to strengthen our existing partnerships, from the United Nations to the Commonwealth and to NATO, seeking to resolve conflict in countries across the world, from Colombia and Cyprus to Somalia and Yemen.\\nBut we must never forget that we stand here at the United Nations as servants of the men and women that we represent back at home. As we do so, we must recognize that for too many of these men and women, the increasing pace of globalization has left them feeling left behind. The challenge for those of us in this Hall is to ensure that our Governments and our global institutions such as the United Nations remain responsive to the people we serve, and that we are capable of adapting our institutions to the demands of the twenty-first century and of ensuring that they do not become irrelevant.\\nSo when it comes the big security and human rights challenges of our time, we need this, our United Nations, to forge a bold new multilateralism, because, as we have seen even in the past week, no country is untouched by the threat of global terrorism, and when extremists anywhere in the world can transmit their poisonous ideologies directly into the bedrooms of people vulnerable to radicalization, we need not just work together to prevent conflict and instability in nation States, but to act globally to disrupt the networks that terrorist groups use to finance operations and recruit to their ranks.\\nWhen we see the mass displacement of people on a scale unprecedented in recent history, we must ensure that we are implementing the policies that are fit for the challenges we face today. And when criminal gangs do not respect our national borders, trafficking our fellow citizens into lives of slavery and servitude, we cannot let those borders act as a barrier to bringing such criminals to justice.\\nIn each of these areas, it is the convening power of our United Nations that gives us a unique opportunity to respond. But we can do so only if we modernize and adapt to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.\\nAs a United Nations we have shown how we can work together to reduce the threat of international terrorism by preventing conflict and instability from developing. For example, as a permanent member of the Security Council, Britain has played a leading role in the fight against Al-Shabaab in Somalia. Since 2010, with huge support from across the region and, critically, the commitment of Somalis themselves, Al-Shabaab has been driven from all the major cities it used to control.\\nIt is vital that as an international community we continue to support countries in the region that are contributing thousands of troops, and that we continue to build the capacity of Somali security forces. That is why the United Kingdom is now going to increase further our security support, and we will be calling on others to do the same, hosting an international conference on Somalia in 2017, to maintain this vital momentum. Missions like this must remain central to the work of the United Nations, but on their own they are not enough, because the terrorist threats we face today do not come from one country but rather exist in a different space. The global networks they exploit require a different kind of global response.\\nThese organizations are using our own modern banking networks against us. We therefore need to look at our regulations and information-sharing and use our technological capabilities to get ahead of them. They are targeting our airlines, exploiting the fact that no one country can keep its citizens safe when they are flying between multiple jurisdictions. That is why this week the United Nations will vote on a United Kingdom- led draft resolution on aviation security so that every country implements the standards we need to ensure that no country is the weak link.\\nThey are exploiting the Internet and social media to spread an ideology that is recruiting people to their cause all over the world. We therefore need to tackle this ideology head-on. That is why the United Kingdom has championed the work that the Secretary-General has led to develop a strategy for preventing violent extremism. Now, as an international community, we must work together to adopt and implement the most comprehensive national action plans to tackle both the causes and the symptoms of all extremism. It is not enough merely to focus on violent extremism. We need to address the whole spectrum of extremism — violent extremism and non-violent extremism, Islamist and neo-Nazi, hate and fear in all their forms.\\nJust as we need the United Nations to modernize to meet the challenges of terrorism in the twenty-first century, so too must we adapt if we are to fashion a truly global response to the mass movements of people across the world and its implications for security and human rights. The 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol must remain the bedrock of our response, but the context in which they must be applied has dramatically changed.\\nAcross the world today, there are 65 million people who have been forcibly displaced. That is the equivalent of the entire population of the United Kingdom. It is an unprecedented figure, one that has almost doubled in a decade. And yet United Nations appeals are underfunded, host countries are not getting enough support and refugees are not getting the aid, education and economic opportunities they need. We must do more. As the second-largest bilateral provider of assistance, the United Kingdom remains fully committed to playing a leading role.\\nIn the past five years, the United Kingdom has invested over $9 billion in humanitarian assistance, saving millions of lives every year. The London Conference on Syria in February raised $12 billion in pledges, the largest amount ever raised in one day in response to a humanitarian crisis. And that money is being used to combine both urgent humanitarian assistance and vital economic development, benefiting both refugees and the communities and countries hosting them. Clearly, we need to continue our efforts to bring an end to the conflict and the appalling slaughter in Syria and to get aid through to those who need it.\\nWhile these efforts continue inside Syria, we also need new efforts to support refugees and host communities in neighbouring countries, including through education and opportunities to work. These efforts are complemented by loans from international financial institutions and access to European markets. Through our trading relationships and direct engagement with businesses, we are mobilizing the private sector to create new jobs in the region for everyone. While there is more to be done, it is this approach to financing both humanitarian support and economic development that I will be championing when I announce a further United Kingdom financial contribution at President Obama’s leaders’ summit on the global refugee crisis later today.\\nBut in addition to refugees and displaced people fleeing conflict and persecution, we are also seeing an unprecedented movement of people in search of greater economic opportunities through the same unmanaged channels. That affects all of us, and it is the responsibility of us all to take action. We cannot ignore the challenge or allow it to continue unmanaged. We need to do better — for the countries people leave, for the countries they move through, for the countries they try to get to — and most of all, better for the migrants and refugees themselves.\\nDespite the huge increase in international efforts, more migrants have died attempting hazardous journeys across borders this year than any other. I believe we have to use the opportunity afforded by this session of the General Assembly for an honest global debate to address this global challenge.\\nIn doing so, we should be clear that there is nothing wrong with the desire to migrate for a better life and that controlled, legal, safe, economic migration brings benefits to our economies. But countries have to be able to exercise control over their borders. The failure to do so erodes public confidence, fuels international crime, damages economies and reduces the resources for those who genuinely need protection and whose rights under the Refugee Convention should always be fulfilled. I believe there are three fundamental principles that we now need to establish at the heart of a new approach to managing migration that is in the interests of all those involved.\\nFirst of all, we must help ensure that refugees claim asylum in the first safe country they reach. The current trend of onward movements, where refugees reach a safe country but then press on with their journey, can only benefit criminal gangs and expose refugees to grave danger. We must therefore all do more to support countries where the refugees first arrive, to provide the necessary protection and assistance for refugees safely and swiftly and to help countries adapt to the huge economic impact that refugees can have — including on their existing population.\\nAs we are seeing in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, when the right assistance is provided, solutions that provide sanctuary and opportunity to refugees, and opportunities for those hosting them, can be found. This is also good for the refugees and the countries they come from — because the closer they stay to home, the easier it will be for them to return and rebuild after the conflict.\\nSecondly, we need to improve the ways we distinguish between refugees fleeing persecution and economic migrants. I believe we must ensure that the existing Convention and Protocol are properly applied to provide protection to refugees and reduce the incentives for economic migrants to use illegal routes. This in turn will help us target support for those refugees who need it most and retain the support of our populations for doing so.\\nThirdly, we need a better overall approach to managing economic migration — one that recognizes that all countries have the right to control their borders — and that we must all commit to accepting the return of our own nationals when they have no right to remain elsewhere. By ensuring a managed and controlled international migration response while simultaneously investing to tackle the underlying drivers of displacement and migration at source, we can reject isolationism and xenophobia, thereby achieving better outcomes for all of our citizens, particularly for the most vulnerable.\\nFinally, as we gather here today to bring the founding values of the United Nations to bear on some of the most pressing global problems, the likes of which we have never seen before, we must also face up to the fact that some of the worst human rights abuses, which we thought we had consigned to the history books, have re-emerged in new, pernicious forms. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, proclaimed by the General Assembly, stated that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, that no one should be held in slavery and servitude and that slavery and the slave trade should be prohibited in all their forms. Yet, nearly 70 years on, we are presented with a new form of slavery — modern slavery. Organized crime groups, which are largely behind this modern slavery, lure, dupe and force innocent men, women and children into extreme forms of exploitation. Trafficked and sold across borders, victims are forced into living the kind of inhumane existence that is almost too much for our imagination.\\nSuch criminals have global networks to help them make money out of some of the world’s most vulnerable people. Victims are held captive in squalid conditions, under the constant shadow of violence and forced into sex and labour exploitation. If we are going to succeed in stamping out this abhorrent crime and bring the perpetrators to justice, we need to confront the reality of what were are dealing with. These organized- crime groups work across borders and jurisdictions. They often use the Internet and modern technology to recruit, transport, control and exploit their victims, all the while staying ahead of legal systems that are often constrained by traditional geographical boundaries.\\nWe must therefore take action. We must use our international law-enforcement networks to track down these criminals wherever they are in the world and put them behind bars, where they belong. We need to be smarter and even more coordinated than the criminal gangs in our efforts to stop them. In the United Kingdom, I am setting up the first-ever Government task force for modern slavery, bringing together every relevant department to coordinate and drive all our efforts in the battle against this cruel exploitation. We are also using our aid budget to create a dedicated fund focused on high-risk countries where we know victims are regularly trafficked to the United Kingdom. Yesterday, I committed the first £5 million from that fund to work in Nigeria, to reduce the vulnerability of potential victims and step up the fight against those who seek to profit from this crime.\\nBut if we are to meet the Sustainable Development Goal to eradicate modern slavery, we need to go much further. Security relationships have developed between many countries for dealing with such issues as counter- terrorism, cybersecurity, drug trafficking and wider intelligence-sharing, but we do not have a similar relationship for the fight against modern slavery. We therefore need our law-enforcement agencies to work together, with joint investigation teams working across multiple countries. Victims will find freedom only if we cultivate a radically new, global and coordinated approach to defeating this vile crime. Together, we must work tirelessly to preserve the freedoms and values that have defined our United Nations from its inception. Together, we must work tirelessly to restore these freedoms and values to the lives of the men, women and children who are exploited for profit and held captive with little or no chance of escape.\\nFrom the Declaration of St. James’s Palace and the Atlantic Charter forged by Winston Churchill and President Roosevelt to the first meeting of the General Assembly in London in 1946, the United Kingdom has always been an outward-looking, global partner at the heart of international efforts to secure peace and prosperity for all our peoples. And that is how we will remain. For when the British people voted to leave the European Union, they did not vote to turn inwards or walk away from any of our partners in the world. Faced with challenges like migration, a desire for greater control of their country and a mounting sense that globalization is leaving working people behind, they demanded a politics that is more in touch with their concerns and bold action to address them.\\nBut that action must be more global, not less, because the biggest threats to our prosperity and security do not recognize or respect international borders. And if we focus only on what we do at home, the job is barely half done. This is not the time to turn away from our United Nations. It is the time to turn towards it. Only we, as members of this community of nations, can act to ensure that this great institution becomes as relevant for our future as it has been in our past.\\nLet us therefore come together, true to our founding values but responsive to the challenges of today, and let us work together to build a safer, more prosperous and more humane world for generations to come.\\n',\n",
       " '“We want a future in which everyone lives a happy life and loves one another”. Those words were recently written in the Book of Ideas by a six-year-old boy named Lovro when he visited my office along with a number of other children to mark the beginning of the new school year in Croatia. But they could easily have been written by any child in the world. It is a simple, yet powerful, wish. In order to transform our world, we as leaders must listen to Lovro’s words. And for that reason I want his voice to be heard today in the General Assembly. Everyone can agree that those simple truths, among which are the right to a happy life and the freedom of choice, as universal drivers of\\na better world, are indeed the ultimate objectives of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\\nA year has passed since we adopted the milestone Agenda 2030, and we are now one step and one year closer to its deadline. Today, in terms of achievements and responsibilities, I would like to address sustainable development by focusing on human potential, natural resources and resilient societies.\\nWe have all signed onto the Agenda, our plan of action for people, planet and prosperity. People should be at the heart of our efforts, with youth at the very core. Our goal as leaders is to empower our youth through education and give them opportunities to be the catalysts of transformation and progress. Now is the time to start viewing our youth as the guardians of Agenda 2030, because in 14 years whatever progress we have achieved will be theirs to carry on.\\nI would agree with many who argue that even today, in 2016, we must decide whether we opt for open or closed societies. Whatever we do to safeguard the future should be done with determination, with clear choices in mind.\\nThere is much work to be done. We must begin by restoring public confidence in Governments and international organizations. We must embrace our common values with strength, courage and true conviction — beginning with tolerance — and become active and dedicated builders of a world where there is no room for despair.\\nTrue inclusiveness means more than just being open to cooperation and raising awareness from time to time. It should be a continuous search for consensus, nationally and internationally, and the active involvement of all stakeholders in building new strategic alliances. There is an evident need for ending the prevailing silo approach, if we are to achieve synergies when implementing mutually interdependent goals. Security, prosperity and human rights go hand-in-hand and cannot be separated.\\nAccording to the latest UNICEF statistics, over 50 million children are currently uprooted, and almost 60 million children do not have access to primary education. Those children are counting on us to give them the chance they deserve. We should not act only when moved by images, such as those of the Syrian boys Aylan and Omran, which are true symbols of our world gone horribly wrong.\\nThe optimism and resilience shown by children and, most of all, their unbridled honesty are qualities that I respect and admire. All children should have the right to their childhood and education. It is devastating to know how many children could not begin class this autumn because they are victims of the various global crises that we allow to persist.\\nIn terms of unlocking global human potential, I believe that if we want to give future generations a chance for a better life by 2030, we must address three main, mutually reinforcing, phenomena: large-scale migrations, demographic dynamics and youth unemployment. We need a predictable, humane, responsible and legally sound system of governing international migration. Croatia commends the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1), which the General Assembly adopted on Monday, as well as the Agenda for Humanity presented at the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul last May. Implementing them together with Agenda 2030 will help us address the root causes of the large movements of people. On that issue we need not minimize anyone’s dignity or rights, nor underestimate the perils that surround them.\\nOur immediate focus should be two-fold. We must provide assistance to both the countries of origin and the receiving countries in order to promote safe, regular and orderly migration management. We must promote global efforts to counter organized-crime networks involved in human trafficking. What we have is a global crisis of human mobility and, as such, it requires a global response.\\nWe must end the policy of double standards and the hypocritical approach to the tragedy that is unfolding as we speak. We must help those who have managed to leave the fields of destruction, but we must also do our utmost to assist those who have stayed behind and are left with no means of or strength to escape.\\nAll societies, developed and underdeveloped alike, are currently facing not only one generation, but several generations, of youth that are unemployed, disappointed and discouraged, while others are trying to escape from conflict, violence and intolerance. They are extremely sceptical about their future and become easy prey for all kinds of manipulation and radicalization.\\nSocial media and modern communications technology are becoming a double-edged sword. They provide us with unparalleled opportunities, making the world interconnected in ways that only yesterday few dared to dream of. At the same time, they carry the dark potential to spread hatred and intolerance and build invisible walls around those who look or think differently. We must pay special attention to that possibility and find the prudence to use new technologies to improve not only our daily lives, but also our hearts and minds.\\nEducation, knowledge and tolerance are more than just the tools of choice when dealing with political and social discrimination, exclusion and the prevention of violent extremism and terrorism. They are the way forward. They are the key to success and are fundamental drivers of sustainable development.\\nConstant investment in education systems always pays back with big dividends. Ever more countries are recognizing the necessity of a comprehensive education reform, because too many current education systems are generating youth who cannot find employment. Education has the power to multiply opportunities. It is an engine that creates choices, providing every individual with the freedom to choose a path of his or her own.\\nGender inequality is the most pervasive form of global inequality and a pressing human rights concern. Women and girls continue to be exposed to a range of obstacles to their complete and full inclusion in social, economic and political life. There will be no real progress without a gender-responsive implementation of Agenda 2030. For us to succeed we need more women in politics and business, in diplomacy and on executive boards. But that will not happen without men. Their role in the empowerment of women, their support and understanding, are as crucial as the will of women to succeed.\\nThis year, Croatia is chairing the Equal Futures Partnership — an innovative multilateral initiative aimed at encouraging Member States to empower women economically and politically. The high-level meeting of its members and supporters will take place tomorrow. I invite all those present to find the time to pay due attention to that endeavour.\\nNature is just as irreplaceable as people are. Development strategies must seriously take into account our natural resources as the fundamental starting point. Climate change is a powerful weapon of mass destruction that is going out of control. We have very little time to reverse that self-destructive course. Climate change is also a risk multiplier for other security challenges, including large-scale migrations and regional instability born out of hopelessness and desolation. We must ensure climate action and make sure that the recent Paris Agreement enters into force as soon as possible.\\nAs a country on the northern shores of the Mediterranean, Croatia is following the developments across that cradle of our civilization with care and deep concern. The southern Mediterranean has, sadly, become a sea of dangerous journeys, where the legendary tales of the classical world are being replaced by new stories of human suffering, where ancient monuments are being reduced to dust and where indifference to human life sometimes reaches an unimaginable scale. The stability, security and well-being of the Mediterranean remain a priority of Croatian foreign policy.\\nOur societies are exposed to a complex global security environment with increased mutual dependencies. There is a whole range of hybrid threats to national and international security: violent extremism, terrorism, foreign terrorist fighters, uncontrolled migration, organized crime, risks related to the cyberenvironment, and the malicious use of new technologies. Large-scale migrations and unemployment are interconnected, just as failed States and fragile Governments are related to conflict.\\nTerrorism continues to represent not only a security concern, but also a detrimental economic factor for every country, causing millions of people to leave their homes in search of safety and prosperity. We need to strengthen the resilience of our societies at the grass- roots level, particularly the fabric of multicultural and multi-confessional societies, against terrorist propaganda, attempts at violent radicalization and other extremist actions. In addition to our efforts to promote sustainable and long-term de-radicalization and fight terrorist narratives, especially those in cyberspace, we need to address the underlying socioeconomic drivers of terrorism, such as poverty, inequality, unemployment, the lack of education and the lack of economic prosperity.\\nWhen countering global threats that impede the emergence and growth of resilient societies, the issue of disarmament must remain at the forefront. Recently, we achieved success in the development and implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty and the Convention on Cluster Munitions. At the same time, large parts of the United Nations disarmament machinery are stalled. The 2015 Review Conference of Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons remains a case in point. In our quest for a more secure global community, we must spare no effort in the field of the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\\nTwenty years have passed since the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was opened for signature, but we still need to invigorate our determination to become a nuclear-test-free world. New technologies and the fourth industrial revolution are changing our lives for the better in more ways than one. However, they also have a negative impact on security and disarmament. Technologies such as 3-D printing are changing the algorithm in the area of conventional weapons, and the misuse of cyberspace might have unforeseen consequences in the chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear areas. We must therefore broaden our reach when it comes to disarmament topics and align it with new realities.\\nCroatia considers participation in international missions and operations to be a principal duty that can contribute to peace. In that regard, we are preparing to place the Croatian Army Engineering Horizontal Construction Company at the disposal of United Nations peacekeeping operations.\\nToday, on the International Day of Peace, it is necessary to emphasize that women are powerful agents of peace and security. We must not treat women only as victims of conflict and violence. Women are powerful agents of change. Their growing contribution to the prevention and resolution of conflict, as well as to the maintenance of a sustainable and inclusive peace, should be encouraged. More female peacekeepers could help us combat sexual violence, promote gender awareness among the host nations’ populations and improve relationships with local citizens. In order to contribute to that goal, Croatia is conducting a United Nations training course for women police officers from Asia, Africa and Europe. The course is organized back- to-back with predeployment military training in order to enhance the synergy between the military and civilian sectors by integrating the gender and multicultural aspects of peacekeeping.\\nWe commend the Secretary-General for advancing the responsibility to protect. Over the past 10 years, a lot has been accomplished in building consensus around that concept and strengthening the will and capacity for its implementation. Croatia advocates the further strengthening of the role of the International Criminal Court so that it can assume greater responsibility in prosecuting mass atrocities and war crimes, including criminal acts against cultural heritage committed by State or non-State actors. We believe that it is of paramount importance to put an end to the culture of impunity. And that must be done without any politicization, without putting daily politics above the rule of law and, certainly, without rewriting or misinterpreting history.\\nIt is through hard-earned wisdom that we lave learned that there can be no true justice without peace or peace without justice. Establishing individual accountability through strong evidential and legal norms is essential. International tribunals and judicial mechanisms can lay the foundations needed to make the voices of victims heard and to record volumes of evidence in the annals of history, but it is up to each society to bring the process of reconciliation to its end.\\nRespect for, and the protection of, human rights is a prerequisite for sustainable peace and development. Our work in that area should never end. We strongly support and advocate the Human Rights Up Front initiative. Through its candidacy for membership in the Human Rights Council for the period 2017-2019, Croatia looks forward to constructively contributing to and strengthening the Council’s work in the promotion, protection and further development of human rights.\\nCroatia will continue to be actively engaged in the United Nations reform process. We commend recent progress in the process of electing the next Secretary- General and strengthening the Office of the President of the General Assembly. However, the Organization is still lagging behind in terms of what is expected concerning Security Council reform, as highlighted by the number of ongoing, prolonged and nascent crises in the world. We have great expectations for the next Secretary-General. We hope that she or he will give bold impetus to the processes of carrying forward our Organization, making it even more effective, accountable, transparent and, above all, more relevant.\\nThe world has been yearning for inspirational and effective leadership. The solidarity of our global society is deteriorating as problems pile up and hope diminishes. Will we accept that we are creating a world led by feelings of separation, fear and cynicism because we have allowed violence, injustice and crises to prevail? Or will we reverse those trends and choose to achieve a better tomorrow?\\nFourteen years from now, our children will not ask us what we planned together or what we signed up to do. Instead, they will ask us what we achieved together and whether we made a difference. And we as leaders need therefore to inspire our citizens again and act together today.\\nI want to end with a message to all of the children in Croatia and in the world: their voices provide us with guidance and serve as an obligation for all of us who gather here at this permanent meeting point of humankind. Lovro may only be 6 years old, but his voice resonates today in the General Assembly Hall, and he is making a difference.\\n',\n",
       " 'What I am about to say is going to shock everyone — Israel has a bright future at the United Nations. I know that hearing that from me must surely come as a surprise, because year after year I have stood at this very rostrum and slammed the United Nations for its obsessive bias against Israel. And the United Nations has deserved every scathing word — for instance, for the disgrace of the General Assembly last year, which adopted 20 resolutions against the democratic State of Israel and a grand total of three resolutions against all the other countries on the planet. Israel, 20; the rest of the world, three.\\nAnd what about the joke called the United Nations Human Rights Council, which each year condemns Israel more than all the countries of the world combined? As women are being systematically raped, murdered and sold into slavery across the world, which is the only country that the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women chose to condemn this year? Yes, Israel. Israel, where women fly fighter jets, lead major corporations, head universities, preside — twice — over the Supreme Court, and have served as Speaker of the Knesset and Prime Minister. And that circus continues at UNESCO, the United Nations body charged with preserving world heritage. This is hard to believe, but UNESCO just denied the 4,000-year connection between the Jewish people and its holiest site, the Temple Mount. That is just as absurd as denying the connection between the Great Wall of China and China.\\nThe United Nations, which began as a moral force, has become a moral farce. Therefore, when it comes to Israel at the United Nations, one might well think that nothing will ever change. Well, think again. Everything will change, and a lot sooner than one might think. The change will happen in this Hall, because back home Governments are rapidly changing their attitudes towards Israel. Sooner or later, that is going to change the way everyone votes on Israel at the United Nations.\\nMore and more nations in Asia, in Africa and in Latin America see Israel as a potent partner in fighting the terrorism of today and in developing the technology of tomorrow. Today, Israel has diplomatic relations with over 160 countries, nearly double the number from when I served here as Israel’s Ambassador some 30 years ago. Those ties are getting broader and deeper every day. World leaders increasingly appreciate that Israel is a powerful country with one of the best intelligence services on Earth. Because of our unmatched experience and proven capabilities in fighting terrorism, many Governments will seek our help in keeping their countries safe.\\nMany also seek to benefit from Israel’s ingenuity in agriculture, in health, in water, in cybersecurity and in the fusion of big data, connectivity and artificial intelligence — that fusion that is changing our world in every way. Israel leads the world in recycling wastewater. We recycle about 90 per cent of our wastewater. How remarkable is that? Given that the next country on the list recycles only about 20 per cent of its wastewater, Israel is a global water Power. If we have a thirsty world, and we do, there is no better ally than Israel.\\nHow about cybersecurity? That is an issue that affects everyone. Israel accounts for one tenth of 1 per cent of the world’s population, yet last year we attracted some 20 per cent of the global private investment in cybersecurity. If we digest that number, we see that Israel is punching a whopping 200 times above its weight. Therefore, Israel is also a global cybersecurity Power. If hackers are targeting banks, planes, power grids and just about everything else, Israel can offer indispensable help. Governments are changing their attitudes towards Israel because they know that Israel can help them protect, feed and improve the lives of their people.\\nThis summer, I had an unbelievable opportunity to see that change vividly during an unforgettable visit to four African countries. That was the first visit to Africa by an Israeli Prime Minister in decades. Later today, I will be meeting with leaders from 17 African countries. We will discuss how Israeli technology can help them in their efforts to transform their countries. In Africa, things are changing. In China, India, Russia and Japan, attitudes towards Israel have changed as well. Those powerful nations know that, despite Israel’s small size, it can make a big difference in many areas that are important to them.\\nBut now I am going to surprise everyone even more. The biggest changes in attitudes towards Israel is taking place elsewhere. It is taking place in the Arab world. Our peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan continue to be anchors of stability in the volatile Middle East. For the first time in my lifetime, many other States in the region recognize that Israel is not their enemy. They recognize that Israel is their ally. Our common enemies are Iran and the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham. Our common goals are security, prosperity and peace.\\nI believe that, in the years ahead, we will work together to achieve those goals, work together openly. Therefore, Israel’s diplomatic relations are undergoing nothing less than a revolution. But in that revolution we never forget that our cherished alliance, our deepest friendship, is with the United States of America, the powerful and the most generous nation on Earth. Our unbreakable bond with the United States of America transcends parties and politics. It reflects, above all else, the overwhelming support for Israel among the American people, support which is at record highs and for which we are deeply grateful.\\nThe United Nations denounces Israel; the United States supports Israel. And a central pillar of that defence has been America’s consistent support for Israel at the United Nations. I appreciate President Obama’s commitment to that long-standing United States policy. In fact, the only time that the United States cast a Security Council veto during the Obama presidency was against an anti-Israel draft resolution in 2011 (see S/PV.6484). As President Obama rightly declared at this rostrum, peace will not come from statements and resolutions at the United Nations. I believe the day is not far off when Israel will be able to rely on many countries to stand with us at the United Nations. Slowly but surely, the days when United Nations Ambassadors reflexively condemn Israel are coming to an end.\\nToday’s automatic majority against Israel at the United Nations reminds me of the incredible story of Hiroo Onada, who was a Japanese soldier sent to the Philippines in 1944. He lived in the jungle. He scavenged for food. He evaded capture. Eventually he surrendered, but that did not happen until 1974, some 30 years after the end of the Second World War. For decades, Hiroo refused to believe the war was over. As Hiroo was hiding in the jungle, Japanese tourists were swimming in pools in American luxury hotels in nearby Manila. Finally, mercifully, Hiroo’s former commanding officer was sent to persuade him to come out of hiding. Only then did Hiroo lay down his arms.\\nI have one message for those present here today, that is, that they too should lay down their arms. The war against Israel at the United Nations is over. Perhaps some of those present do not know it yet, but I am confident that one day in the not too distant future they will also get the message from their leaders informing them that the war against Israel at the United Nations has ended. Yes, I know, there might be a storm before the calm. I know there is talk about ganging up on Israel at the United Nations later this year.\\nGiven the United Nations history of hostility towards Israel, does anyone really believe that Israel will let the United Nations determine our security and our vital national interests? We will not accept any attempt by the United Nations to dictate terms to Israel. The road to peace runs through Jerusalem and Ramallah, not through New York. But regardless of what happens in the months ahead, I have total confidence that, in the years ahead, the revolution in Israel’s standing among the nations will finally penetrate this Hall of nations.\\nI have so much confidence, in fact, that I predict that a decade from now an Israeli Prime Minister will stand right here where I am standing and actually applaud the United Nations. But I want to ask: why do we have to wait a decade? Why keep vilifying Israel? Perhaps because some do not appreciate that the obsessive bias against Israel is not just a problem for my country, it is a problem for the other countries too. If the United Nations spends so much time condemning the only liberal democracy in the Middle East, it has far less time to address war, disease, poverty, climate change and all of the other serious problems that plague the planet.\\nAre the half-million slaughtered Syrians helped by Member States’ condemnation of Israel? The same Israel that has treated thousands of injured Syrians in our hospitals, including a field hospital that I built right along the Golan Heights border with Syria. Are the gays hanging from cranes in Iran helped by acts to denigrate Israel? That same Israel where gays march proudly in our streets and serve in our Parliament, including, I am proud to say, in my own Likud party. The starving children in North Korea’s brutal tyranny, are they helped by the demonization of Israel? Israel, whose agricultural know-how is feeding the hungry throughout the developing world? The sooner the United Nations obsession with Israel ends, the better — the better for Israel, the better for other countries, the better for the United Nations itself.\\nIf United Nations habits die hard, Palestinian habits die even harder. President Abbas just attacked, from this rostrum, the Balfour Declaration. He is preparing a lawsuit against Britain for that declaration from 1917. That is almost 100 years ago — talk about being stuck in the past. The Palestinians may just as well sue Iran for the Cyrus Declaration, which enabled the Jews to rebuild our Temple in Jerusalem 2,500 years ago. Come to think of it, why not a Palestinian class action suit against Abraham for buying that plot of land in Hebron where the fathers and mothers of the Jewish people were buried 4,000 years ago? It is as absurd as that. To sue the British Government for the Balfour Declaration? Is he kidding? And that is taken seriously here?\\nPresident Abbas attacked the Balfour Declaration because it recognized the right of the Jewish people to a national home in the land of Israel. When the United Nations supported the establishment of a Jewish State in 1947, it recognized our historical and our moral rights to our homeland. Yet today, nearly 70 years later, the Palestinians still refuse to recognize those rights — not our right to a homeland, not our right to a State, not our right to anything. And that remains the true core of the conflict: the persistent Palestinian refusal to recognize the Jewish State in any boundary. One can see that the conflict is not about the settlements. It never was.\\nThe conflict raged for decades before there was a single settlement, when Judea, Samaria and Gaza were all in Arab hands. The West Bank and Gaza were in Arab hands, and they attacked us again and again and again. And when we uprooted all 21 settlements in Gaza and withdrew from every last inch of Gaza, we did not get peace from Gaza — we got thousands of rockets fired at us from Gaza.\\nThe conflict rages because for the Palestinians the real settlements they are after are Haifa, Jaffa and Tel Aviv. Keep in mind, the issue of settlements is a real one, and it can and must be resolved in final-status negotiations. But this conflict has never been about the settlements, nor about establishing a Palestinian State. It has always been about the existence of a Jewish State, a Jewish State within any boundaries. Israel is ready, as am I, to negotiate all final-status issues. However, one thing I will never negotiate is our right to our State, the one and only Jewish State. Change may be coming sooner than I thought.\\nHad the Palestinians said yes to a Jewish State in 1947, there would have been no war, no refugees and no conflict. When the Palestinians finally say yes to a Jewish State, we will be able to end our conflict once and for all.\\nThe real tragedy is that the Palestinians are not only trapped in the past, but their leaders are poisoning the future. By way of illustration, I want the Assembly to imagine a day in the life of a 13-year-old Palestinian boy named Ali. Ali wakes up before school and goes to soccer practice with a team named after Dalal Mughrabi, a Palestinian terrorist responsible for the murder of a busload of 37 Israelis. At school, Ali attends an event sponsored by the Palestinian Ministry of Education honouring Baha Alyan, who last year murdered three Israeli civilians.\\nOn his walk home, Ali looks up at a towering statue erected just a few weeks ago by the Palestinian authorities to honour Abu Sukar, who detonated a bomb in the centre of Jerusalem, killing 15 Israelis. When Ali gets home, he turns on the television and sees an interview with a senior Palestinian official, Jibril Rajoub, who says that, if he had a nuclear bomb, he would have detonated it over Israel that very morning.\\nAli then turns on the radio, and he hears President Abbas’ adviser Sultan Abu al-Einein urging Palestinians to “slit the throats of Israelis wherever you find them”. Ali checks his Facebook, and he sees a recent post by President Abbas’ Fatah party, calling the massacre of 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972 a “heroic act”. On YouTube, Ali watches a clip of President Abbas himself saying “we welcome every drop of blood spilled in Jerusalem”.\\nOver dinner, Ali asks his mother what would happen if he killed a Jew and went to an Israeli prison. She tells him that he would be paid thousands of dollars each month by the Palestinian authorities. In fact, she tells him that the more Jews he killed, the more money he would get. When he gets out of prison, Ali would be guaranteed a job with the Palestinian authorities.\\nAll of that is not just a story, it is real. It happens every day, all the time. Sadly, Ali represents hundreds of thousands of Palestinian children who are indoctrinated with hate during every moment of every hour. That is child abuse. Imagine if it were our children undergoing such brainwashing. Imagine what it takes for a young boy or girl to break free of such a culture of hate. Some do, but far too many do not.\\nHow can any of us expect young Palestinians to support peace when their leaders poison their minds against peace? In Israel we do not do that; we educate our children for peace. In fact, my Government recently launched a pilot programme to make the study of Arabic mandatory for Jewish children, so that we can better understand each other, and so that we can live together side by side, in peace. Of course, like all societies, Israel has fringe elements. But it is our response to those fringe elements that makes all the difference.\\nLet us consider the tragic case of Ahmed Dawabsha. I shall never forget visiting Ahmed in the hospital, just hours after he was attacked. This little boy — a baby — was badly burned. Ahmed was the victim of a horrible terrorist attack perpetrated by Jews. He lay bandaged and unconscious as Israeli doctors worked around the clock to save him. No words could bring comfort to this boy or to his family. Nevertheless, as I stood by his bedside, I told his uncle: “This is not our people. This is not our way”. I then ordered extraordinary measures to bring Ahmed’s assailants to justice, and today the Jewish citizens of Israel accused of attacking the Dawabsha family are in jail awaiting trial.\\nFor some, that story shows that both sides have their extremists and that both sides are equally responsible for our seemingly endless conflict. However, what Ahmed’s story actually proves is the very opposite. It illustrates the profound difference between our two societies. While Israeli leaders condemn terrorists — Arabs and Jews alike — Palestinian leaders celebrate terrorists. While Israel jails the handful of Jewish terrorists among us, the Palestinians pay thousands of terrorists among them.\\nI therefore call upon President Abbas to tell him that he has a choice to make. He can continue to stoke hatred, as he did today, or he can finally confront hatred and work with me to establish peace between our two peoples. I know that many of you have given up on peace, but I want it to be known that I have not given up on peace.\\nI remain committed to a vision of peace based on two States, for two peoples. I believe, more than ever before, that changes taking place in the Arab world today offer a unique opportunity to advance that peace. In that connection, I commend President Al Sisi of Egypt for his efforts to advance peace and stability in our region.\\nIsrael welcomes the spirit of the Arab Peace Initiative and welcomes a dialogue with Arab States to advance a broader peace. I believe that, in order for that broader peace to be fully achieved, the Palestinians have to be part of it. I am ready to begin negotiations to achieve that today without any further delay.\\nAlthough President Abbas spoke here an hour ago, would it not be better if, instead of speaking past each other, we were speaking to one another? I invite President Abbas to speak to the Israeli people at the Knesset in Jerusalem, instead of railing against Israel at the United Nations in New York. I would gladly come to speak to the Palestinian Parliament in Ramallah.\\nWhile Israel seeks peace with all our neighbours, we also know that peace has no greater enemy than the forces of militant Islam. The bloody trail of such fanaticism runs through all the continents represented here. It runs through Paris and Nice, Brussels and Baghdad, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, Minnesota and New York. From Sydney to San Bernadino, so many have suffered its savagery: Christians and Jews, women and gays, Yazidis and Kurds and many others.\\nYet the heaviest price of all has been paid by innocent Muslims — hundreds of thousands mercilessly slaughtered, millions turned into desperate refugees, tens of millions brutally subjugated. The defeat of militant Islam will therefore be a victory for all humankind. It will especially be a victory for the many Muslims who seek a life without fear — a life of peace, a life of hope.\\nTo defeat the forces of militant Islam, we must fight them relentlessly. We must fight them in the real world. We must fight them in the virtual world. We must dismantle their networks, disrupt their funding channels and discredit their ideology. We can defeat them, and we will defeat them. Medievalism is no match for modernity. Hope is stronger than hate. Freedom is mightier than fear. We can do it.\\nIsrael fights the fateful battle against the forces of militant Islam every day. We keep our borders safe from the Islamic State. We prevent the smuggling of game-changing weapons to Hizbullah in Lebanon. We foil Palestinian terror attacks in the West Bank. We deter missile attacks from Hamas-controlled Gaza.\\nThat is the same Hamas terror organization that cruelly — unbelievably cruelly — refuses to return three of our citizens and the bodies of our fallen soldiers, Oron Shaul and Hadar Goldin. Hadar Goldin’s parents, Leah and Simcha Goldin, are here with us today. They have one request: to be able to bury their beloved son in Israel. All they ask for is one simple thing: to be able to visit the grave of their fallen son, Hadar, in Israel, but Hamas refuses. Hamas could not care less. I implore everyone to stand with Hadar’s parents, with us, with all that is decent in our world against the inhumanity of Hamas, which represents all that is indecent and barbaric. Hamas breaks every humanitarian rule in the book. Throw the book at them.\\nThe greatest threat to my country, to our region and ultimately to our world remains the militant Islamic regime of Iran. Iran openly seeks Israel’s annihilation. It threatens countries across the Middle East. It sponsors terror worldwide. This year, Iran has fired ballistic missiles in direct defiance of Security Council resolution 2231 (2015). It has expanded its activities in Iraq, Syria and in Yemen. Iran, the world’s foremost sponsor of terrorism, continues to build its global terror network. That terror network now spans five continents. My point is as follows: the threat that Iran poses to all of us is not behind us; it is in front of us. In the coming years, there must be a sustained and united effort to push back against Iran’s aggression and terror. With the nuclear constraints on Iran one year closer to being removed, let me be clear: Israel will not allow the terrorist regime in Iran to develop nuclear weapons — not now, not in a decade, not ever.\\nI stand before the Assembly at a time when Israel’s former President Shimon Peres is fighting for his life. Shimon is one of Israel’s founding fathers, one of its boldest statesman and one of its most respected leaders. I know that the Assembly will join me and the people of Israel in wishing him a speedy recovery. I have always admired Shimon’s boundless optimism. Like him, I am filled with hope.\\nI am filled with hope because Israel is capable of defending itself by itself against any threat. I am filled with hope because the valour of our fighting men and women is second to none. I am filled with hope because I know that the forces of civilization will ultimately triumph over the forces of terror. I am filled with hope because in the age of innovation, Israel, the innovation nation, is thriving like never before. I am filled with hope because Israel works tirelessly to advance equality and opportunity for all its citizens: Jews, Muslims, Christians, Druze, everyone. I am filled with hope because despite all the doubters, I believe that in the years ahead Israel will forge a lasting peace with all our neighbours.\\nI am hopeful about what Israel can accomplish because I have seen what Israel has accomplished. In 1948, the year of Israel’s independence, our population was 800,000. Our main export was oranges. People said that we were too small, too weak, too isolated and too demographically outnumbered to survive, let alone thrive. The sceptics were wrong about Israel then, and the sceptics are wrong about Israel now. Israel’s population has grown tenfold. Our economy has grown fortyfold. Today, our biggest export is technology. Israeli technology powers the world’s computers, cell phones, cars and so much more.\\nThe future belongs to those who innovate, and that is why the future belongs to countries like Israel. Israel wants to form partnerships in seizing that future, and so I call on all those present to embrace Israel, to cooperate and dream with Israel. Dream of the future that we can build together — a future of breathtaking progress, a future of security, prosperity and peace, a future of hope for all humankind, a future where even at the United Nations, even in this Hall, Israel will finally, inevitably, take its rightful place among the nations.\\n',\n",
       " 'As we approach the close of this day, I feel the responsibility to refer from this rostrum to the statement addressed to all of us by the President of the United States, Barack Obama (see A/71/PV.8). In summarizing the past eight years of his presidency and his relationship with the United Nations, he highlighted how the international context today is riven by a deep division between the world of fear and the world of courage, between the world of resentment and the world of hope, and between anger and opportunity.\\nA new season is therefore beginning, one filled with opportunities and possibilities, but also with unprecedented threats and difficulties that, until a short while ago, had seemed in all likelihood to be very remote. Foremost among them is the threat of terrorism to our cities, to everyday life. Terrorism no longer strikes only conventional targets, but rather the human dimension: a theatre, a restaurant, a museum, a stadium. Also pressing are the risks connected with pandemics, which are sometimes exaggerated but very often constitute grave risks, as well as the risks connected to the environment, to which this community of women and men, together with my colleagues, was able to give a response by signing the important Paris Agreement on Climate Change this past April.\\nBut there are also risks linked with other events that combine to make the future seem more a time of concern than of hope, from risks connected to natural disasters — one of which Italy experienced a few weeks ago in Amatrice, Cumuli and Arquata — to the great questions concerning migration and the worries that that phenomenon instils in the hearts of people, the questions it raises and the difficulties it presents. The future has therefore become more and more a place of doubt, of fear. Yet we need to choose the road of hope, the road of possibility, the road of opportunity.\\nThe problems are not in fact theoretical problems that need to be tackled by an assembly of experts. These problems have a face: it is the face of Omran, the Syrian boy, shell-shocked, covered in blood, looking with his big eyes not so much at the photographer’s lens as at the hearts of each one of us; it is the eyes of Nadia, the Yazidi girl whom I met yesterday, who escaped from the violence of Da’esh and is today a courageous witness in a battle on behalf of human rights, of women’s rights, of freedom.\\nThey are challenges and threats for which borders no longer exist. They are in the hearts of our cities and sometimes on the outskirts of European cities, which have often forgotten the true sense of threats inside our borders rather than outside them. Every reference to what happened between Paris and Brussels is deliberate.\\nI therefore wondered, in conveying the greetings of Italy, which voice from Rome I should bring to those issues. It would be nice, of course, to share with the Assembly the words of hope and also of pride that characterize the concrete acts of saving hundreds of thousands of human lives from the Mediterranean — lives otherwise condemned by desperation — by the Italian women and men wearing the uniform of the Navy or the Coast Guard.\\nIt would be nice to bring to each member of the General Assembly the pride and the voice of the Italians who work in the fields of culture, education and research; of Italians who, together with other Europeans, are leading the European mission that in a few weeks will see for the first time a European spacecraft land on Mars, on 19 October, in exactly one month — a sign of the research that is making Europe not only a place of technocrats and bureaucrats, but also a place looking toward the future.\\nYet I would like to propose a different, even provocative image. The image of Rome that I would like to propose is that of Aeneas. Aeneas is the man of the journey. Mythology is filled with examples of people who set out on journeys. Some set out on a journey to return home, like Odysseus. And some, like Aeneas, chose to journey to create a new city, a new civilization.\\nAeneas sets out on a journey carrying on his shoulders his ailing father. It is a sign of a generation that is not afraid to assume its responsibilities and that believes that the experience of the elderly is still an absolute value and will go so far as to bear on its shoulders the added burden of history. Aeneas is the man who ensures for his son, Ascanius, the possibility of going on to live and to found the great history of Rome. But Aeneas is the man who, in the foundation myth, is the bearer of pietas, the sense of profound respect, halfway between the religious value and the profound sense of cultural identity that makes a community worthy of being called a community. Without pietas, without compassion for others, there is no room for community. And this is why, to my mind, it is essential that we tackle the challenge launched this morning from this rostrum by Barack Obama with the great value of pietas and the building of communities to which the myth of Aeneas refers.\\nThis is how Italy will tackle the challenges of 2017: by participating in the Security Council, a responsibility that it will share with the Netherlands. It will participate in the Council, which will see a new Secretary-General, with the assumption of responsibility and the conviction that the Sustainable Development Goals, the challenges associated with environmental and technological sustainability and the building of an ever-stronger community will reflect the values that have made our history great. In 2017 Italy will participate in the life of the international community by hosting, on 25 March, the States members of the European Union for the sixtieth anniversary of the signing of the European Treaty, with the goal of making of Europe not merely an evocation of history but rather a new chapter in a book to be written with increased ideals, dreams, horizons and vision, not with a tiring and repetitive day-by-day listing of bureaucratic rules and decisions.\\nItaly will lead the work of the Group of Seven (G- 7), which will meet at a splendid site in Sicily — that land of great culture and great values — by the Greek theatre in Taormina, facing Mount Etna with the Mediterranean Sea before it bathing the shores of that extraordinary region. The agenda will focus on the actions that we have been discussing today: increasing our contributions to development cooperation and investments in education. For we must not forget that, if the terrorist problem has its origins in theatres of war, there is also a terrorist problem originating in the abandoned outskirts of our cities, and the only weapon that can counter such terrorism is an enormous investment in education and human capital.\\nWe are very proud that the Italian Government has adopted a law, with the support of representatives of Parliament, that stipulates that for every euro invested in security, policing, cybertechnology and cybersecurity, one euro must be invested in culture, education, recreation, preschool education, theatres and other venues that nurture the spirit and the soul, because that is another way to fight the crisis of our era.\\nWe will ensure that the meeting of the G-7 serves as an important occasion to reflect on the values of identity and culture, as well as the challenge of food in the double sense of the fight against poverty and starvation, on the one hand, and the value of food security and health awareness, on the other. At the same time, we are convinced that the challenge facing the Security Council, the challenge facing Europe and the challenge facing the G-7 share the same root, based on the same blueprint.\\nIt is our duty as Italians to bring our voice and our contribution to the United Nations in seeking and identifying ancient values with a new inflection. Today, the pietas of Aeneas has become an opportunity to build a new world based on hope and not on resentment, hatred or anger. Our people, our men and women, continue to work to serve the ideals of peace. They include our women and men in diplomacy and politics, and the women and men who serve our country by wearing a uniform in Afghanistan and in Somalia, by protecting the Mosul Dam in an area fundamental to the future of our planet, and by serving in the Balkans as well, in particular in Serbia. They are security professionals with additional features, namely, the priority they place on humanity.\\nThe women and men who make us proud to be a part of the Italian heritage know that we have not originated from nothing, but rather from the tradition to which I have referred, one that finds its highest expression represented by the Mediterranean Sea. The Mediterranean is the sea that the Romans called Mare Nostrum — our sea. It is the sea where today hundreds and thousands of people seek refuge as they flee from war, from hunger and from poverty. The responsibility for that part of the world has become our ever-growing burden.\\nIn comparison, while we can say that progress has been made in Libya since last year, too little has been accomplished by the international community, particularly Europe, in transforming the Mediterranean Sea into a place where we meet the challenge of dignity. If we do not prioritize the values of humanity and pietas in that geographic area, in that corner of the world, we will have betrayed our tradition. That is why Italy accepts the challenge launched today by the President of the United States to the General Assembly by stating that we will always be on the side of democracy, freedom, values and ideals, with the determination that flows from those who have a great dream and a great vision, but also at the same time the deep desire to make politics into a noble and concrete activity, by intervening without leaving the responsibility for follow-up to others and by fully embracing the deeper meaning of the challenge that we, for our part, call humanity.\\n',\n",
       " 'I wish to express my sincere condolences to the Government and the citizens of Dominica and the Caribbean region, who are suffering from the destruction caused by the hurricanes. Switzerland will support the region.\\nSince the year 2000, humankind has made remarkable progress in the fight against these major scourges: hunger, extreme poverty and difficulties in accessing education. But famine still affects 800 million people in the world, and every 10 seconds a child dies from malnutrition. Other challenges include climate change, global inequality, conflict and humanitarian disasters, as well as forced displacement and migration. No country, no actor on the world stage is in a position to find, alone, the answers to the challenges of today. They are too large. They are too complex. They transcend borders, and they concern the entire international community.\\nWe therefore need a forum where we can meet. We need a forum where we can develop solutions and monitor their implementation. We need an actor with the necessary legitimacy to contribute to the implementation of these solutions on the ground.\\nI would like to recall Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations. The purpose of the United Nations is to maintain international peace and security and, to that end, to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to peace. Collective, not individual. Because I am a patriot and because I defend, as the President of Switzerland, the interests of my country, we need a strong multilateral system. We need a strong United Nations.\\nIn other words, we need the United Nations, and we need a strong United Nations. The fact that we must be reminded of that is a sign that should put us on alert. In order to preserve and strengthen the capacity of the United Nations, we must invest ceaselessly. Switzerland is actively involved in that regard. Investment in substantive issues is a top priority. It is important that we place at the heart of the activities of the United Nations the issues that will be of fundamental importance, tomorrow as today.\\nIn that regard, the States Members of the United Nations have made important strides in recent years. I am thinking, of course, of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and of the desire to transfer resources from post-conflict management to prevention, in order to intensify peacebuilding activities. In those areas, it is necessary to make progress towards the objectives set. In that respect, the 2030 Agenda offers a good example. Its success will be measured by the yardstick of its implementation.\\nImportant steps have also been taken within the United Nations. Switzerland welcomes in particular the reforms of the United Nations system that Secretary- General Guterres is working to achieve in the three areas of peace and security, development and management.\\nWith regard to peace and security, Switzerland supports the priority that the Secretary-General gives to prevention for a very simple reason. When a conflict arises, the price to pay — humanitarian, economic and financial — is much higher than the cost of prevention activities. In order to strengthen conflict prevention, it is essential to promote human rights. Switzerland calls on all States to support the appeal of 13 June, which calls for human rights to be at the core of conflict prevention. Increasing mediation capabilities is another important means of preventing conflicts. In addition, the Global High-level Panel on Water and Peace, launched at the initiative of Switzerland, proposed yesterday, here in New York, measures to better prevent water- related conflicts. The United Nations and regional organizations can play a major role in that regard.\\nSwitzerland is actively committed to the non-proliferation and the complete elimination of nuclear weapons, the use of which would have catastrophic humanitarian consequences. It is convinced that only negotiations and a diplomatic process will lead to a solution to the security situation posed by the nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula.\\nTrust is another important aspect. If an actor is to be able to take effective preventive measures, that actor needs to be trusted. For the United Nations, this means that the quality of the partnership established with the host State concerned and its population is of paramount importance. Sexual exploitation and sexual abuse break this relationship of trust. That is why Switzerland supports the Secretary-General’s action against all forms of sexual abuse and sexual exploitation committed by United Nations staff in the field. As part of its commitment to that issue, Switzerland will contribute to the Trust Fund in Support of Victims of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse.\\nWith regard to the United Nations development system, we welcome the proposal to further encourage joint initiatives by the various entities of the Organization.\\nAllow me to mention two examples of areas where we face major challenges: migration and digital technology.\\nBy the end of 2016, the number of displaced persons across the world had reached a level not seen since the Second World War. The majority of them have been displaced in their own country. In Europe, for example, we must succeed in finding a solution based on solidarity between countries, and we must stabilize the political situation in Libya. Switzerland is working to ensure that the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration addresses not only the challenges caused by international migration, but also its opportunities. The road ahead remains long. It is necessary that all States participate in that work. We are pleased to be able to contribute concretely to its success thanks to the involvement our Permanent Representative in New York’s as a co-facilitator of the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration.\\nAnother topical challenge is the advent of digital technology, which is dramatically transforming the world. It represents a great opportunity, but also a cross-border challenge. Topics such as access to the Internet for all and the impact of digitization on sustainable development, as well as cybersecurity, should be addressed together. The twelfth Internet Governance Forum, which Switzerland will host in Geneva in December, will provide an opportunity to discuss those issues.\\nSo as to maintain the capacity of the United Nations, we must also invest in the relevant processes — because the United Nations stands out as much by its areas of work as by its methods of work. Effective and modern management is needed to ensure the robustness of the United Nations system. Reforms in management are therefore essential.\\nIn our interconnected world, dialogue is essential. Dialogue requires the time and involvement of all parties. It has to be conducted on a broad basis and involve all the relevant actors. For example, it appears that political dialogue among States is insufficient with regard to combating climate change. Extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, clearly show that the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change must be implemented quickly. Scientists believe that if nothing is done, such phenomena will become a new reality with which we will have to deal. The private sector, whose role in innovation, progress and development is essential, is involved, for example, in developing solutions, in consultation with the scientific community and the political sphere. Scientific diplomacy and exchanges with scientists allow us to make the right decisions. As policymakers, we must base our decisions on established facts.\\nSwitzerland is firmly convinced of the importance of investing in a well-functioning multilateral system, particularly in an efficient United Nations. Confronted by current challenges, and in the interconnected world that is ours, the notion of “every man for himself” is not a feasible option.',\n",
       " 'Our world is unpredictable, and much of that unpredictability is the result of climate change. Climate change could be counterbalanced by rapid changes in our wasteful way of life, aided by technology. Clearly, although technological development — especially as it is illustrated by the rapidly developing digital technologies to which billions now have access — has a positive potential for transformation, it actually adds to the difficulties of understanding our future. This new world offers opportunities. Unfortunately, it also enhances the risks. To take advantage of the former and manage the latter, we need to take flexible and quick action, and on the global stage.\\nEstonia, a nation of just over 1 million inhabitants, is sensitive to the fact that those who are inherently weak — the poor, the disabled and the very young or very old — find it especially hard to cope with unpredictability. It is hard for those who have been rendered weak by discrimination, which is often the case for women and ethnic and religious minorities. Estonia itself has gone through a rapid transformation during the more than quarter century that has passed since it regained independence. As our economic and social statistics prove, we have done quite well in protecting our society’s weaker groups, while rapidly adapting and growing our economy. We know it can be done.\\nWe suffered for a long time from the international community’s Hobbesian conviction that liberty could about bring chaos, and that bad leadership is better than no leadership. Our guiding principles have therefore been those of John Locke — the rule of law, checks and balances and individual rights. Notably, Locke had originally agreed with Hobbes, but changed his mind while on a diplomatic mission observing civil society in Brandenburg, where, as he described it, differing ideas had the right to quietly coexist. That debate has continued into modern times.\\nWe know how to offer our know-how on empathic, inclusive development at the global discussion table. Estonia is seeking election to the Security Council for the period from 2020 to 2021. As a small State that was occupied for 50 years of its 100-year history, Estonia is sensitive to the concerns of all States and people who lack the capacity to withstand global tides. Too many States in the world are suffering from unresolved conflicts, and they are States that could take care of their own peoples and contribute at the global level if we could more quickly manage the conflicts that are holding them back or, worse, threatening to tear them apart.\\nThe ongoing military aggression in eastern Ukraine continues to stir up conflict and cause casualties among civilians, including the loss of a member of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe’s Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine. The Crimean peninsula is still occupied, as are parts of Georgia. There are protracted conflicts in Transnistria and Nagorno Karabakh. Many countries have been torn apart by tensions that we recognized but could not dissipate in time to avoid the worst.\\nThe world has lost half a million people in Syria. Estonia supports the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism to Assist in the Investigation and Prosecution of Persons Responsible for the Most Serious Crimes under International Law Committed in the Syrian Arab Republic since March 2011.\\nWe cannot overlook the escalating suffering of the people of Yemen, or ignore the fate of the Rohingya people. We must put more effort into humanitarian action to combat the hunger, diseases and epidemics looming in various countries. Our common efforts to combat famine and hunger will also be crucial in South Sudan, Somalia and Nigeria.\\nNot every State is mobilizing its resources, efforts and technological advances for the benefit of its people. North Korea is an acute threat to world peace.\\nThere are also considerable risks to global stability that are no longer linked to any specific State. The risk of terrorism is metastatic. Spawned initially by the disappointments and disillusionment of people from failed and failing States, it has spread globally. The key to successfully countering terrorism and violent extremism lies in our cooperation at all levels — national, regional and global. The Secretary- General’s initiative to restructure the counter-terrorism architecture at the United Nations will render global efforts more coordinated and transparent. Effective counter-terrorism measures and the protection of human rights are mutually reinforcing, not conflicting, goals.\\nWhat I have just mentioned — and which has already been exacerbated by the real effects of climate change and, unfortunately, will be even more so in the future — has led to the highest number of displaced people the world has ever seen. As with all global challenges, the United Nations is the natural entity for working out and agreeing on a solution. Last year, we adopted the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants. We must address the root causes and drivers of irregular migration in order to improve border management and fight human trafficking, while also facilitating opportunities for legal migration. I would like to emphasize that the underlying basic values of our joint endeavours are humanism and solidarity. For Estonia, the importance of empathy for refugees who are fleeing the atrocities of war and destruction is a bitter lesson from our own history, when occupations and the Second World War dispersed our people around the world.\\nIf we want to deal with the root causes of migration, we must tackle climate change, which has become the defining issue of our time. Joint efforts to combat climate change on a global scale would not be possible without the coordinating role of the United Nations and the platform offered by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). We have confidence in the Fiji presidency’s ability to achieve concrete results during the twenty-third session of the Parties to the UNFCCC, to be held in November, building on last year’s achievements in Paris.\\nAs the response led by society to the threats of climate change shows, big, universal problems can be tackled by inclusive societies. Inclusive societies are fundamental to empathic and inclusive development. However, in recent years we have witnessed a shrinking of the space available to civil society. That trend must be reversed. One of the most prominent guarantees for empathic and inclusive development in democracy and the rule of law is the mainstreaming of gender equality in all areas of life. It is a proven fact that treating women and men equally has a multiplier effect in eradicating poverty. Estonia’s welfare development plan for 2016-2023 covers policy areas from employment and social inclusion to equal opportunities for applying our talents in all walks of life. Our goal is the balanced participation of women and men at all levels of decision-making and management, in both the public and the private sectors.\\nWe should also not forget about gender balance in conflict situations. Engaging women in the early stages of prevention, crisis resolution and peacebuilding helps to reduce the probability of a relapse into violent conflict. We should therefore encourage women’s participation in peace processes and acknowledge them as actors of change with great potential. And we must be tireless in implementing Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) and related resolutions on women and peace and security at every level. The Peacebuilding Commission’s adoption of a gender strategy last year was a major milestone on that road.\\nIf women are to fully play their role in society, it is crucial to eliminate gender-based violence. We should ensure that its survivors are treated with dignity and that its perpetrators are held accountable for their crimes. Estonia continues to support actions that address gender- based violence and the reproductive-health needs of women and adolescent girls who are particularly vulnerable — for example, via the United Nations Population Fund in Ukraine and by supporting the #shedecides initiative. I am convinced that Secretary- General Guterres’ commendable effort to bring more women into United Nations decision-making will also be an inspiration to women globally, and have a tangible effect on United Nations policy development, making it more empathic and inclusive.\\nToday, the use of information technology and the Internet is part of the everyday lives of people everywhere. Estonia can share its experience on how best to utilize e-governance to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals more efficiently and cheaply. We have been organizing an event series at the United Nations with the aim of introducing the well-established benefits of our e-governance to the international community, and we sincerely hope that they will lead to concrete action and partnerships. Moreover, this summer, Estonia and Singapore launched the Group of Friends on e-Governance and Cybersecurity. The Group’s aim is to raise awareness, share best practices and promote capacity-building, at a time when such topics are becoming increasingly important at the United Nations level.\\nDigital change is everywhere. Its biggest effect right now is its ability to make geography obsolete. Attacks via cyberspace know no limits. Friendships and partnerships formed in the cybersphere know no borders. Globally, all these things diminish the distance between us. A digitally enhanced global civil society functions better if States provide their people with safe ways to communicate digitally. In the analogue world, it is easy to identify ourselves even to people we do not know, because States have provided us with passports. We need similar identification for the cybersphere, and yet too few Governments provide the means for safe identification. They should catch up and ensure that their people are protected and able to conduct transactions and communicate safely online.\\nOur greater dependence on electronic services has brought greater vulnerability in cyberspace, but that does not mean that we can, or should try, to stop digital progress. We should continue our efforts to analyse how international law applies to the use of information and communications technology, particularly with regard to the principle of due diligence, countermeasures, the potential application of the right to self-defence and international humanitarian law. I call on all States that have not yet done so to accede to the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime. I would also like to underline the statement of the Freedom Online Coalition, expressing deep concern about the growing trend in intentional State-sponsored disruptions both of access to information online and its dissemination. No one should be denied the right to peaceful assembly or to freedom of association, opinion or expression, whether in real life or online.\\nIn order to address all of those challenges successfully, we need a strong United Nations. Estonia welcomes the Secretary-General’s agenda for United Nations reform and strongly supports efforts to link reform of the United Nations peace and security architecture with reform of its development system. We welcome the emphasis on conflict prevention and peacebuilding, which renders societies resilient to vulnerabilities.\\nEstonia’s chairmanship of the Second Committee is firmly guided by the principles of inclusivity and empathy. It is in our common interests to ensure that the Second Committee tackles the global challenges\\nthat fall under its remit. We count on members’ good faith in achieving that.\\nAs a member of the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency group, Estonia has been working closely with a number of countries to improve the working methods of the Security Council, and the functioning of the United Nations as a whole. We need empathy and inclusivity, including in the Security Council. That is why Estonians hope that our first-time candidature for a non-permanent member seat for the period 2020-2021 will be successful. We regained independence 26 years ago, but we already have 22 years of participation in United Nations peacekeeping under our belt. As a small country, we care for all those who are vulnerable in the world. As a digital society, we are a story of hope and of rapid transformation from a poor country recovering from occupation to one that is able to provide for its own citizens and contribute to multilateral cooperation. Again, as a digital State, we consider transparency and being close to people as obligations of a State. We are adamant supporters of rules-based decision-making and clarity of process. We are with those who want to make the United Nations more nimble in order to face the challenges of the twenty-first century.',\n",
       " 'I would like to begin by expressing my sincere condolences to the Government and the people of Mexico following the devastating earthquake. I also want to reiterate my sympathies to those affected by the recent hurricanes in the Caribbean. Our thoughts are with them all at this time.\\nAs we meet at the General Assembly, we face challenges that go right to the heart of who we are as nations — challenges that test our values, our vision and our resolve to defend the rules and standards that underpin the security and prosperity of our fellow citizens. As I argued in my speech here last year, many of those challenges do not recognize or respect geographical boundaries.\\nI think, of course, of the terrorism that has struck so many of our countries — including my own, five times this year —and, fuelling that terrorist threat, of the increasing numbers being drawn to extremist ideologies, not only in places riven by conflict and instability but many online in their homes, thousands of miles away from those conflicts. I think of climate change, which is depleting and degrading the planet we leave to our children. And I think of the vast challenges that come from the mass displacement of people. Many are refugees fleeing conflict and persecution. Others are economic migrants prepared to risk everything on perilous sea crossings in the desperate search for a better life for themselves and their children.\\nThrough that migration we also see the challenges of economic inequality, between countries and within them. That inequality, together with weaknesses in the global trading system, threatens to undermine support for the forces of liberalism and free trade that have done so much to propel global growth, and it is pushing some countries towards protectionism in the belief that that best defends the interests of their own people.\\nAs the global system struggles to adapt, we are confronted by States deliberately flouting, for their own gain, the rules and standards that have secured our collective prosperity and security — the unforgivable use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime against its own people and, perhaps foremost in our minds today, the outrageous proliferation of nuclear weapons by North Korea and a threat to use them.\\nI believe that the only way for us to respond to that vast array of challenges is to come together and defend the international order that we have worked so hard to create and the values by which we stand. For it is the fundamental values that we share, values of fairness, justice and human rights, that have created the common cause among nations to act together in our shared interests and form the multilateral system. It is that rules-based system that we have developed — including the institutions, the international frameworks of free and fair trade, agreements such as the Paris Climate Agreement, and laws and conventions like the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons — that enables a global cooperation through which we can protect those values.\\nIndeed, the defining purposes set out in the Charter of the United Nations are to maintain international peace and security, to develop friendly relations among nations, to achieve international cooperation in solving the problems of an economic, social, cultural and humanitarian character, and to be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations in the attainment of those common ends. I do not see those as vaunted ideals to be held to their own sake. Those values and the rules they imbue are central to our national interest, to our security and prosperity. The international system, with the United Nations at its heart, is the amplifying force that enables countries to cooperate and live up to those standards in word, spirit and deed, to our collective and individual benefit.\\nIf the system we have created is found no longer to be capable of meeting the challenges of our time, then there will be a crisis of faith in multilateralism and global cooperation that will damage the interests of all our peoples. Those of us who hold true to our shared values, who hold true to that desire to defend the rules and high standards that have shaped and protected the world we live in, need to strive harder than ever to show that institutions like the United Nations can work for the countries that formed them and for the people who we represent.\\nThat means reforming the United Nations and the wider international system so it can prove its worth in helping us to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century. It also means ensuring that those who flout the rules and spirit of our international system are held to account, that nations honour their responsibilities and play their part in upholding and renewing a rules- based international order that can deliver prosperity and security for us all.\\nFirst, we must insure that our multilateral institutions can deliver the aspirations on which they were founded. Think of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees looking after those who have been driven out of their homes; the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons striving for a world free of chemical weapons; the United Nations Children’s Fund helping children in danger. Those are all vital missions where the United Nations surely has a unique role to play. That is why the United Kingdom has over 70 years been such a pioneering supporter of those organizations, and more.\\nBut we should also acknowledge that throughout its history the United Nations has suffered from a seemingly unbridgeable gap between the nobility of its purposes and the effectiveness of its delivery. When the need for multilateral action has never been greater, the shortcomings of the United Nations and its institutions risk undermining the confidence of States as Members and donors. Even more important, they risk the confidence and faith of those who rely on the Blue Helmets, who rely on that sign I stand in front of today to come to their aid in the darkest of hours.\\nWe must begin by supporting the ambitious reform agenda that Secretary-General Guterres is now leading to create a more agile, transparent and joined-up Organization. Much of the work will be practical and unglamorous. It will require the United Nations to deliver better cooperation on the ground between agencies, remove competition for funding and improve gender equality. But it will also require real leadership to confront damaging issues that have beset the United Nations. I therefore welcome the Secretary- General’s new circle of leadership on preventing sexual exploitation and abuse in United Nations operations, and I am pleased to be part of that initiative.\\nWe, the nations of the United Nations, need to give the Secretary-General our backing for those reforms. As an outward-looking, global Britain and the second-biggest funder of the United Nations, the United Kingdom will remain committed to spending 0.7 per cent of gross national income on development and humanitarian support. We will use our military to support peacekeeping, and our diplomats will continue to work to tackle conflict and to support peacebuilding. In turn, the United Nations and its agencies must win our trust by proving to us and the people we represent that they can deliver. That is why we will remain generous in our funding but will set aside 30 per cent to be paid only to those parts of the United Nations that achieve sufficient results.\\nBut this is about more than technical reforms, important as they are. It is also about reforms that enable the United Nations to truly respond to the global challenges of the twenty-first century. At last year’s General Assembly we undertook to do far more to resolve the challenges of refugee and migration flows. We agreed to develop global compacts to address the causes and the consequences of the mass movements of people we see today. That was an important step to elevate significantly our global response and enable us collectively to tackle this challenge of our times.\\nIn the year ahead, as well as agreeing the principles of those compacts, we must ensure they can be applied in practice. We must do more to identify, protect and support refugees and those hosting them near conflicts. On migration, our starting point must be that it can benefit both countries and migrants themselves, but only when it is safe, orderly, well managed and legal. If we do not manage that effectively, we will fail both our own citizens and those taking those dangerous journeys, and we will push more people into the curse of modern slavery at the hands of the human traffickers and organized criminal groups that drive that inhuman industry.\\nBut the steps we are agreeing through these compacts alone will not be enough. For if people cannot find jobs, opportunity and hope for themselves and their families where they live, they will continue to look elsewhere. As the United Nations and as Members, we must work harder to combine the efforts of our development programmes with the private sector and the international financial institutions to support the creation of jobs and livelihoods that will address not just the consequences but the causes of this great challenge of our time. The truth is that, despite our best efforts, we are not succeeding. We must do more.\\nThe same is true with terrorism, where again, the challenges we face today are vastly different from those of previous eras. When terrorists struck London and Manchester this year the world saw our cities come together in defiance. Our Parliament carries on. Ariana Grande came back to Manchester and sang again. London Bridge is bustling with people. Our communities came together at the Finsbury Park mosque in North London, and Londoners got back on the Tube. The terrorists did not win, for we will never let anyone destroy our way of life.\\nBut defiance alone is not enough. As leaders, we have all visited too many hospitals and seen too many innocent people murdered in our countries. In the past decade, hundreds of thousands have been killed by terrorists across the world. That is a truly global tragedy that is increasingly touching the lives of us all. This year is the tenth anniversary of the death of the woman who introduced me to my husband and who was known well to many of us in the United Nations. Benazir Bhutto was brutally murdered by people who actively rejected the values that all of us here in the United Nations stand for, in a country that has suffered more than most at the hands of terrorists. She was murdered for standing up for democracy, murdered for espousing tolerance and murdered for being a woman.\\nWhen I think of the hundreds of thousands of victims of terrorism in countries across the world, I think of their friends, their families, their communities, devastated by that evil, and I say, enough is enough. Of course, we must continue to take the fight to these terrorist groups on the battlefield. The United Kingdom will remain at the forefront of that effort, while also helping to build the capabilities of our alliances and our partners to better take on this challenge.\\n24/29 17-29395 We must also step up our efforts as never before to tackle the terrorist use of the Internet, for as the threat from terrorists evolves, so must our cooperation. That is why today, for the first time in the United Nations, Governments and industry through the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism will be coming together to do just that. Tech companies have made significant progress on that issue, but we need to go further and faster to reduce the time it takes to remove terrorist content online and to increase significantly their efforts to stop it being uploaded in the first place. That is a major step in reclaiming the Internet from those who would use it to do us harm.\\nBut ultimately it is not just the terrorists themselves who we need to defeat, it is the extremist ideologies that fuel them. It is the ideologies that preach hatred, sow division and undermine our common humanity. We must be far more robust in identifying those ideologies and defeating them across all parts of our societies. As I said in the aftermath of the attack on London Bridge this summer, we have to face the fact that this will require some difficult conversations. We all need to come together, to take on that extremism that lives among us and to nurture the common values that must ultimately win out. They are the values of the United Nations.\\nAnd yet, despite our best efforts, we as nations and as a United Nations have not found the ways or the means to truly take on that threat. That is why today, as I talk about United Nations reform, I ask the Secretary-General to make the fight against terrorists and the ideologies that drive them a core part of his agenda, at the heart of our development, peacebuilding and conflict-prevention work. To give that effort the prominence it surely requires, I am calling on the Secretary-General to make that a theme of next year’s General Assembly and use it to harness the efforts of Governments, the private sector and civil society so that we can truly strike the generational blow against that vile evil in our world.\\nAs we do so, we must clearly strike the balance between protecting our people and protecting their freedoms. We must always guard against those who would use the fight against terrorism as a cover for oppression and the violation of human rights. As we look at the situation in northern Burma, I call on the Burmese authorities to put an end to the violence, allow humanitarian access and fully implement the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State.\\nBy reforming our multinational institutions, we can strengthen their ability to deliver for the people we serve, protect the vulnerable and fight injustice. We can enable multilateralism to multiply the effect of our individual commitments through its convening power and spending power, through the economies of scale it can bring, the standards it can set, the moral leadership it can harness and the legitimacy it can confer. But multilateralism can only reflect the values that individual States project and can only multiply the commitments that they are prepared to make. It is strong nations that form strong institutions and that provide the basis of the international partnerships and cooperation that brings stability to our world.\\nIt falls to us all to decide whether we will honour the responsibilities that we have to one another. I have talked about the role of the United Nations in stepping up on counter-terrorism. But that is an area that we as States have critical responsibilities that the United Nations cannot itself address alone, for it is inescapable that the terrorism, conflict and instability that we see across the world are in many cases driven by the actions of States acting through proxies.\\nWhen countries back groups like Hizbullah to increase instability and conflict across the Middle East, support so-called separatists in Ukraine to create instability on Europe’s eastern borders, or give tacit support to criminal groups launching cyberattacks against our countries and institutions, they call into question the very rules and the international system that protect us. That is why, both globally but also in our own continent of Europe, the United Kingdom will remain steadfast in our commitment and responsibility to ensure the security and stability of our friends and allies as we have done for generations.\\nJust as it the responsibility of nations not to seek to advance their interests through terrorist or proxy groups, so it is also the responsibility of each of us to act together in the face of the most egregious violations of our common rules and standards. Clearly, responsibility for the chaos and tragedy that we see in Syria lies firmly at the door of Al-Assad. He and his backers have continually frustrated the efforts of the United Nations to act as the broker of peace through the Geneva process. As responsible States, we must not abandon our support for the United Nations attempts to secure peace and stability in Syria. Indeed, we must continue to call on all those with influence on the regime to bring them to the table.\\nBut in recent weeks, the United Nations has also confirmed what we all knew, namely, that the Syrian regime has used chemical weapons on its own people. In the face of that fact, we have a responsibility to stand up, to hold the Syrian regime to account. That responsibility sits with us all, but a particular, special responsibility lies on the shoulders of the permanent members of the Security Council. As one of those five members, the United Kingdom takes our special responsibility seriously.\\nI am proud that we have used the full weight of our diplomacy to ensure that we have not had to exercise our veto in a generation. We seek to foster international cooperation, not frustrate it. But others have not done so. One country in particular has used its veto as many times in the past five years as in the whole of the second half of the Cold War. In doing so they have prevented action against a despicable regime that has murdered its own people with chemical weapons. As a result, in Syria, the United Nations has been blocked. That has undermined the values that we hold dear and the international rules-based system that is the basis of security and prosperity around the world.\\nNow we face an even more immediate, global danger in the activities of Kim Jong Un and his regime in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Time after time, he has shown contempt for the international community of law-abiding States, contempt for his neighbours and contempt for the institutions and rules that have preserved peace and security. On that challenge, the United Nations in recent weeks has shown it can step up to the task, with last Monday’s Security Council resolution creating the biggest sanctions package of the twenty-first century. We have seen regional and global Powers coming together and, as in the founding Charter, putting aside limited self- interests to show leadership on behalf of the wider world.\\nBut despite those efforts, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea continues to defy and provoke the international community and threaten its neighbours. Unless all Security Council members continue to live up to the special responsibilities that are placed upon us and, in seeking to resolve that crisis, to be prepared to take on necessary measures to tackle that threat, we will not be able to bring stability to the Korean peninsula.\\nAs the world looks on, I am calling for further steps and for nations with that special responsibility to work together and exert the pressure we know is necessary to force Kim Jong Un to change his ways. Let us not fail this time. Let our message to North Korea be clear: our determination to uphold those rules is stronger by far than their determination to undermine them.\\nThroughout the history of the United Nations, countries have shown time and time again that by being true to our values, rules and standards, it is possible to come together and to deliver in ways that have the most extraordinary impact on the lives of the people we serve. I believe we can do so again. We must do so again, and we will do so again.',\n",
       " 'We are in the midst of a great revolution — a revolution in Israel’s standing among the nations. It is happening because so many countries around the world have finally woken up to what Israel can do for them. Those countries now recognize what brilliant investors like Warren Buffett and great companies like Google and Intel have recognized and known for years, that is, that Israel is the innovation nation, the place for cutting-edge technology in agriculture, in water, in cybersecurity, in medicine, in autonomous vehicles. You name it, we have got it.\\nThose countries now also recognize Israel’s exceptional capabilities in fighting terrorism. In recent years, Israel has provided intelligence that has prevented dozens of major terrorist attacks around the world. We have saved countless lives. Members may not know it, but their Governments do. And they are working closely together with Israel to keep their countries and its citizens safe.\\nI stood here last year, at this rostrum, and I spoke about that profound change in Israel’s standing around the world (see A/71/PV.14). Just look at what has happened since. In one year, hundreds of Presidents, Prime Ministers, Foreign Ministers and other leaders have visited Israel — many for the first time. Of those many visits, two were truly historic. In May, President Trump became the first American President to include Israel in his first visit abroad. President Trump stood at the Western Wall, at the foot of the Temple Mount, where the Jewish people’s temples stood for nearly 1,000 years. When the President touched those ancient stones, he touched our hearts forever.\\nIn July, Prime Minister Modi became the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Israel. Some here may have seen the pictures. We were on a beach in Hadera. We rode together in a Jeep outfitted with a portable desalination device that some thriving Israeli entrepreneur invented. We took off our shoes, waded into the Mediterranean and drank seawater that had been purified only a few minutes earlier. We imagined the endless possibilities for Israel, for India and for all of humankind.\\nIn the past year, Israel has hosted many world leaders. I had the honour of representing my country on six different continents in one year. I went to Africa, where I saw Israeli innovators increasing crop yields, turning air into water, fighting AIDS. I went to Asia, where we deepened our relations with China and Singapore, and expanded our cooperation with our Muslim friends in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. I went to Europe, where, in London and Paris, Thessaloniki and Budapest we enhanced our security and economic ties. I went to Australia, becoming the first Israeli Prime Minister to visit our great allies down under. And just last week, I went to South America, visiting Argentina and Colombia, and then I went on to Mexico — becoming, if members can believe it, the first Israeli Prime Minister to visit Latin America. After 70 years, the world is embracing Israel, and Israel is embracing the world.\\nIn one year, I visited six continents. It is true that I have not yet visited Antarctica, but I want to go there too, because I have heard that penguins are also enthusiastic supporters of Israel. Members laugh. But penguins have no difficulty recognizing that some things are black or white, are right or wrong. Unfortunately, when it comes to United Nations decisions about Israel, that simple recognition is too often absent. It was absent last December, when the Security Council adopted anti-Israel resolution 2334 (2016), which set back the cause of peace.\\nIt was absent last May, when the World Health Organization — one has to listen to this — adopted a Syrian-sponsored draft resolution that criticized Israel for health conditions on the Golan Heights. As the great John McEnroe would say, “You cannot be serious!” That is preposterous. Syria has barrel-bombed, starved, gassed and murdered hundreds of thousands of its own citizens, and wounded millions more, while Israel has provided life-saving medical care to thousands of Syrian victims of that very same carnage. Yet who does the World Health Organization criticize? Israel.\\nIs there no limit to United Nations absurdities when it comes to Israel? Apparently not, because in July, UNESCO declared the Tomb of the Patriarchs in Hebron a Palestinian World Heritage Site. That is worse than fake news; that is fake history. While it is true that Abraham, the father of both Ishmael and Isaac, is buried there, so are Isaac, Jacob, Sarah, Rebecca and Leah — who just happen to be patriarchs and matriarchs of the Jewish people. Members will not read about that in the latest UNESCO report. But if members want to read about it, they can in a somewhat weightier publication. It is called the Bible. I highly recommend it. I hear it got four and a half out of five stars on Amazon, and it is a great read. I read it every week.\\nLet me now be serious. Despite the absurdities, despite the repetition of those farcical events, there is change. Slowly, but surely, there are signs of positive change — even at the United Nations. I very much appreciate the statement of the Secretary-General, indicating that denying Israel’s right to exist is anti-Semitism — pure and simple. That is important, because for too long the epicentre of global anti-semitism has been right here at the United Nations. And while it\\nmay take many years, I am absolutely confident that the revolution of Israel’s ties with individual nations will ultimately be reflected here in this Hall of nations. I say that because there is also a marked change in the position of some of our key friends. Thanks to President Trump’s unequivocal support for Israel in this organ, that positive change is gathering force. I thank President Trump for supporting Israel at the United Nations, and I thank Ambassador Nikki Haley for her support. I thank them for speaking the truth about Israel.\\nHere at the United Nations we must also speak the truth about Iran, as President Trump did so powerfully this morning. I served as Ambassador to the United Nations and I am a long-serving Israeli Prime Minister, so I have listened to countless speeches in this Hall. But I can say this — none were bolder, none were more courageous and forthright, than the one delivered by President Trump today. President Trump rightly called the nuclear deal with Iran “an embarrassment”. I could not agree with that more. Here is why — Iran vows to destroy my country every day. That vow was repeated by its Chief of Staff the other day. Iran is conducting a campaign of conquest across the Middle East. And Iran is developing ballistic missiles to threaten the entire world.\\nTwo years ago, I stood here and explained why the Iranian nuclear deal not only did not block Iran’s path to the bomb, but actually paved it. That is because the restrictions placed on Iran’s nuclear programme have what is called a “sunset clause”. Let me explain what that term means. It means that in a few years those restrictions will be automatically removed, not by a change in Iran’s behaviour, not by a lessening of its terror or its aggression, but merely by a change in the calendar. I warned that when that sunset came, a dark shadow would be cast over the entire Middle East and the world — because Iran would then be free to enrich uranium on an industrial scale, placing it on the threshold of a massive arsenal of nuclear weapons.\\nThat is why I said two years ago that the greater danger was not that Iran would rush to a single bomb by breaking the deal, but that Iran would be able to build many bombs by keeping the deal. In the past few months we have all seen how dangerous even a few nuclear weapons can be in the hands of a small rogue regime. Imagine the danger of hundreds of nuclear weapons in the hands of a vast Iranian Islamist empire, with the missiles to deliver them anywhere on Earth. I know that there are those who still defend the dangerous deal with Iran, arguing that it will block Iran’s path to the bomb. That is exactly what they said about the nuclear deal with North Korea, and we all know how that turned out. Unfortunately, if nothing changes, this deal will turn out exactly the same way.\\nThat is why Israel’s policy regarding the nuclear deal with Iran is very simple — change it or cancel it, fix it or nix it. Nixing the deal means restoring massive pressure on Iran, including crippling sanctions, until Iran fully dismantles its nuclear-weapon capabilities. Fixing the deal requires many things, among them inspecting military sites and any other site that is suspect, and penalizing Iran for every violation. Above all, fixing the deal means getting rid of the sunset clause. Beyond fixing this bad deal, we must also stop Iran’s development of ballistic missiles and roll back its growing aggression in the region.\\nI remember we have had these debates. As members know, I took a fairly active role in them. Many supporters of the deal naively believed that it would somehow moderate Iran and make it a “responsible” member of the international community. I strongly disagreed. I warned that, when the sanctions on Iran would be removed, Iran would behave like a hungry tiger unleashed — not joining the community of nations, but devouring nations one after the other. That is precisely what Iran is doing today. From the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean Sea, from Tehran to Tartus, an Iranian curtain is descending across the Middle East. Iran spreads that curtain of tyranny and terror over Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and elsewhere. And it pledges to extinguish the light of Israel. Today I have a simple message for Ayatollah Khamenei, the dictator of Iran: the light of Israel will never be extinguished.\\nThose who threaten us with annihilation put themselves in mortal peril. Israel will defend itself with the full force of our arms and the full power of our convictions. We will act to prevent Iran from establishing permanent military bases in Syria for its air, sea and ground forces. We will act to prevent Iran from producing deadly weapons, in Syria or in Lebanon, for use against us. And we will act to prevent Iran from opening new terror fronts against Israel along our northern border. As long as Iran’s regime seeks the destruction of Israel, Iran will face no fiercer enemy than Israel.\\nBut I also have a message today for the people of Iran, who are not our enemy. They are our friends. One day my Iranian friends will be free from the evil regime that terrorizes them, hangs gays, jails journalists, tortures political prisoners and shoots innocent women like Neda Soltani, leaving her choking on her own blood on the streets of Tehran. I have not forgotten Neda, and I am sure that neither have members. When the day of liberation for the people of Iran finally comes, the friendship between our two ancient peoples will surely flourish once again.\\nIsrael knows that we are not alone in confronting the Iranian regime. We stand shoulder to shoulder with those in the Arab world who share our hopes for a brighter future. We have made peace with Jordan and Egypt, whose courageous President, Mr. Abdel Fattah Al Sisi, I met here last night. I appreciate President Al Sisi’s support for peace, and I hope to work closely with him and other leaders in the region to advance peace. Israel is committed to achieving peace with all of our Arab neighbours, including the Palestinians.\\nYesterday President Trump and I discussed all of this at great length. I appreciate President Trump’s leadership, his commitment to stand by Israel’s side, his commitment to advance a peaceful future for all. Together, we can seize the opportunities for peace and together we can confront the great dangers of Iran. The remarkable alliance between the United States and Israel has never been stronger and never been deeper. Israel is deeply grateful for the support of the Trump Administration, the American Congress and the American people.\\nIn this year of historic visits and historic anniversaries, Israel has much to be grateful for. A hundred and twenty years ago, Theodor Herzl convened the first Zionist Congress to transform our tragic past into a brilliant future by establishing the Jewish State. One hundred years ago, the Balfour Declaration advanced Herzl’s vision by recognizing the right of the Jewish people to a national home in our ancestral homeland. Seventy years ago, the United Nations further advanced that vision by adopting resolution 181 (II), supporting the establishment of a Jewish State. Fifty years ago, we reunited our eternal capital — Jerusalem — achieving a miraculous victory against those who sought to destroy our State. Theodor Herzl was our modern Moses, and his dream has come true. We have returned to the promised land, revived our language, ingathered our exiles and built a modern, thriving democracy.\\nTomorrow evening Jews around the world will celebrate Rosh Hashanah, the beginning of our new year. It is a time of reflection, and we look back with wonder at the remarkable and miraculous rebirth of our nation. We look ahead with pride to the remarkable contributions Israel will continue to make to all nations. A simple look around will reveal those contributions every day — in the food people eat, the water they drink, the medicines they take, the cars they drive, the cell phones they use and in so many other ways that are transforming our world. It can be seen in the smile of an African mother in a remote village who, thanks to an Israeli innovation, no longer must walk eight hours a day to bring water to her children. It can be seen in the eyes of an Arab child who has flown to Israel to undergo a lifesaving heart operation. And it can be seen in the faces of the people in earthquake-stricken Haiti and Nepal, who are rescued from the rubble and given new life by Israeli doctors.\\nAs the prophet Isaiah said: “I have made you a light unto the nations, to be My salvation to the ends of the Earth.” Today, 2,700 years after Isaiah spoke those prophetic words, Israel is becoming a rising power among the nations. And, at long last, its light is shining across the continents, bringing hope and salvation to the ends of the Earth. Happy new year from Israel.',\n",
       " 'The topic of this year’s debate invites us to focus on people and our responsibility to ensure their peaceful and sustainable future. However, in today’s world, such a peaceful future is threatened as never before. Authoritarian regimes continue to kill with impunity, extremist ideologies treat innocent people with unspeakable cruelty, and thousands die after leaving their homes in search for a better and more peaceful life.\\nThe world’s attention is now focused on North Korea and in some other regions, but the same kinds of blackmail, bullying and aggression that we see there are also being used by Russia in Ukraine and along NATO’s eastern border. As we speak, approximately 100,000 Russian troops are engaged in Exercise Zapad 2017 — offensive military exercises on the borders of Baltic States, Poland and even in the Arctic. The Kremlin is rehearsing aggressive scenarios against its neighbours, training its army to attack the West. The exercise is also part of information warfare that aims to spread uncertainty and fear. It is even more disturbing that the Zapad 2017 exercise is just one symptom of the Kremlin’s inability to finally end its hatred towards the West.\\nDespite Russia’s special responsibility as a permanent member of the Security Council to protect international peace, it violated the Charter of the United Nations by attacking Georgia, illegally annexing Crimea and directly participating in the war in the east of Ukraine. The Kremlin’s arsenal does not stop at conventional weapons. Russia continues to meddle in elections and conduct cyberattacks, and it uses its sputniks to spread fake news and destabilizing propaganda. Energy blackmail has long been Russia’s weapon of choice. For example, in Belarus, just 40 kilometres from Lithuania’s capital, it is building the unsafe Astravyets nuclear power plant as a geopolitical weapon that fails to comply with basic international nuclear standards.\\nAbuses and indifference to basic international norms by regimes across the world are not unrelated. Too often they are a result of our collective failure to condemn or properly react to violations. Time and time again we lack the courage to enforce the rules that we ourselves have established. We draw red lines in the sand and then pretend they do not exist. That has to change. Bullies are aggressive precisely because they are weak and insecure, which is why we must stop being passive observers and start calling things by their real names. Aggression can never make anyone stronger. It can never earn anyone a single drop of respect. The only thing that aggression will bring about is contempt, shame and condemnation.\\nThe international community has to take a share of responsibility. We cannot let fear win by closing our eyes to violators, because that will only encourage them to go further. We must learn to read the warning signs, because abuse of human rights, nationalist rhetoric and the suppression of free speech explode into violence if ignored.\\nFinally, we must change the United Nations. This unique universal body was created to save the world from wars and instability. So far it has failed to fulfil that purpose. We now face a choice — we either give the Organization the voice to rise up against the abuse, or we render it irrelevant.',\n",
       " 'Every era and every decade has its problems, great and small. The problems we face now seem overwhelming. These days many people worry about the future, which is understandable. The past few years have been marked by terrorist attacks all over the world.\\nIn countries like Myanmar, Syria, the Central African Republic and Yemen, the population is suffering as a result of wars and conflicts. More and more people are fleeing their homes because of violence, scarcity or poverty, leaving behind everything they have. Only recently, floods claimed lives in the United States and Asia, and Hurricane Irma has left a trail of destruction in its wake, including in the Caribbean part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Nuclear issues are once again a major concern, and geopolitical tensions are increasing.\\nThat is the picture today. But if we take a long- term perspective — and, as a historian, I like to do that — there are grounds for optimism. This building here in New York — United Nations Headquarters — is concrete proof that progress is possible. Here in this inviolable international zone, thousands of people from every continent work together to foster peace, justice and development in a world governed by international law. That is no easy task, far from it. But advances are being made. Sometimes we take three steps forward and two steps back, but if one takes a long-term view, one can see clear progress.\\nThink back to when the United Nations was established in 1945. Europe lay in ruins, as did Asia. Two nuclear bombs had been dropped on Japan. The Cold War was around the corner and would hold the world in its grip for decades. But the destruction caused by two world wars united the nations of the world in a shared belief that it should never happen again.Franklin D. Roosevelt put it this way in February 1945:\\n“The point in history at which we stand is full of promise and of danger. The world will either move towards unity and widely shared prosperity or it will move apart”.\\nThe world of today is indeed a much better world, and not just geopolitically. In 2015 we took stock of the progress we had made on the Millennium Development Goals. Extreme poverty and maternal mortality had been halved, and child mortality had been almost halved. Ninety per cent of children in developing countries are now receiving primary education. Despite all the very real problems that confront us today, I still see grounds for optimism. We cannot change the world overnight, but we can improve the lives of individuals step by step. And we are doing so.\\nThe United Nations plays a crucial role in those achievements. The United Nations is the only organization where everyone sits at the table, and remains there. While other institutions struggle with an increasing lack of credibility, faith in the added value of the United Nations remains strong among the world’s citizens. We must not let them down.\\nThe Netherlands and its Kingdom partners Curaçao, Aruba and Sint Maarten have always attached great importance to cooperation within the United Nations. Our small, outward-looking kingdom could not exist without strong multilateral institutions and an effective international legal order. As a trading nation, our prosperity depends on a stable world. And after the Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 disaster and attacks in neighbouring countries, the people of the Netherlands are increasingly aware that our domestic security depends on cooperation with other countries. It is very important to the Netherlands and to the victims’ next of kin that justice is seen to be done for those who perished on Flight MH-17. It has been agreed that the next step — the prosecution and trial of those responsible — will take place in the Netherlands. We are working with all the countries involved to make that possible.\\nThe problems confronting today’s world — climate change, migration, food security, terrorism and cybercrime — are by definition international. No single country can tackle them in isolation. We need each other. Instead of becoming more inward-looking, as united nations we need to take a step outwards. In this turbulent world, the importance of the United Nations is growing every day.\\nNext year, the Kingdom of the Netherlands will be even more focused on the United Nations. In January 2018, we begin our one-year term on the Security Council, taking over from Italy. This shared arrangement is a good example of European partnership within international organizations. We would like to see more such cooperation. Our two countries even share some of the same priorities, such as tackling people-smuggling in Libya, an issue that is of great concern to the whole of Europe.\\nFor next year, as a temporary member of the Security Council, we have set three priorities: a strong United Nations and a secure and sustainable world. We will work in a transparent way to achieve that goal, each element of which is equally important.\\nThe first priority, a strong United Nations, is essential. For that, reform and modernization are crucial. As the new Secretary-General, António Guterres, has said, “The onus falls on the United Nations to prove its worth”. He has been active from day one, working to adapt the United Nations to new realities. His ambitious agenda inspires confidence for the future. The Kingdom of the Netherlands supports his vision and approach, and I would like to take this opportunity to call for a joint effort to implement his reform plans. It is time to follow through. And I do not only mean the Secretary-General, but all of us here in\\n17-29395 15/29 this great Hall. Saying that the onus falls on the United Nations means that the onus falls on us.\\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands wants to see a more effective and efficient United Nations, with better cooperation among the various agencies. After all, the fields in which the United Nations is active — human rights, peace and security, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) — are all inextricably linked. The Netherlands already works in this way. We call it the 3-D approach: an integrated effort to tackle development, defence and diplomacy.\\nWe would also like to see the role of the Resident Coordinator reinforced. Moreover, the United Nations will have to work in a results-oriented way, adopt a more modern personnel policy and bolster its internal transparency and accountability. Those are all issues that we will press for in the coming period.\\nOur second priority next year is of course security. The key word here is “prevention”. We are not devoting enough attention to the early stages of conflict development. That has to change. We need an organization equipped and ready for action at all stages of conflict. That is already happening in the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), in which the Netherlands is participating and will continue to participate in 2018. What is new is that we are using intelligence to carry out long-range reconnaissance missions. In that way, we can anticipate conflict, instead of waiting for it to come our way.\\nWe see MINUSMA as a model for future missions. However, we need not only better intelligence, but also task-oriented training for United Nations personnel, high-grade equipment and a clear mandate. This year the Kingdom of the Netherlands is co-organizing the United Nations Peacekeeping Conference in Vancouver. There, we will press for rotation schedules to ensure timely deployment and rotation of both personnel and materiel. That will make countries more willing to participate and extend the potential lifespan of a mission.\\nCounter-terrorism is another issue on which the United Nations is rightly focusing more and more. After all, the United Nations is the prime forum for global norm-setting and international cooperation in the field. When it comes to preventing terrorism, cooperation is key. A good example of such cooperation is the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum (GCTF), which the Netherlands co-chairs together with Morocco. There, 29 countries work together to achieve a single goal: to keep our citizens safe. It is producing concrete results. For instance, at least 60 countries and the United Nations now contribute foreign terrorist profiles to INTERPOL. INTERPOL already has over 16,000 profiles. When the GCTF was set up, it had fewer than 1,000. That work is not high profile — most of it goes on behind the scenes — but it saves many lives.\\nThe prevention of violence and conflict ties in with our third priority — sustainability — and with it, the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. The SDGs precede everything I have just discussed. They are the ultimate prevention agenda. They address the drivers and root causes of instability and conflict. Investing in human dignity, eradicating poverty, fostering climate resilience and promoting economic and social progress will reduce the incidence of conflict, instability and despair — development and lasting peace, all in one package.\\nThe Netherlands and its Kingdom partners Curaçao, Aruba and Sint Maarten are working together to implement the SDGs. We believe that the key to success in attaining the Goals is our willingness to form partnerships at the national and international levels with businesses, civil society organizations, knowledge institutions, local authorities and youth organizations. Working together across sectors is part of our country’s tradition.\\nOur most important area of expertise is water management. Much of the Netherlands lies below sea level, so we have centuries of experience in water technology, urban delta management and maritime technology, expertise that we are keen to share with the rest of the world. Working together on water issues is more crucial than ever before. Nearly five years have elapsed since thousands of people here in New York had to flee their homes when the streets flooded in the wake of Hurricane Sandy. The destruction caused by Harvey in Texas and the floods in Asia show that water issues have only become more urgent in the last five years.\\nThe impact of climate change on the water cycle is brought home to us every day, all over the world, sometimes violently. The people of Sint Maarten, in the Caribbean part of the Kingdom, are struggling to cope with the devastation caused by Hurricane Irma.\\nThe United Nations now predicts that 200 million people will have become displaced by 2050 because of climate change. Water therefore plays a key role in achieving almost all of the SDGs. We learn most by working with others and by sharing knowledge. We deploy our expertise all over the world — for example, in projects in Viet Nam, Peru, Myanmar and Bangladesh. That is one of the reasons that I am a member of the High-level Panel on Water.\\nThis Hall, this building and all members of the Assembly represent one of the greatest achievements of humankind: all the nations working together in partnership to foster peace, justice and development in the world. This is a unique Organization, which entails a heavy responsibility. In such turbulent times, the United Nations needs to prove its worth more than ever. Adlai Stevenson, an American politician who experienced two world wars and died when the Cold War was at its height, once said,\\n“The United Nations is like a spade; it is not self- operating. It is what we make of it, for purposes that we can find in common with our neighbours in the world.”\\nI could not agree more. We face great problems in the present age. Conflict and natural disasters affect the lives of many and cause widespread concern. In this unstable world, the United Nations represents stability and a chance to shape the world for the good. We need to make progress with the reforms proposed by Secretary-General Guterres. Let us consider what we have achieved in recent decades. As they say, past results are no guarantee of future performance, but they do represent a promise for the future. Let us do all we can to make good on that promise, because together we can make the United Nations a success. In the year ahead, the Kingdom of the Netherlands will commit itself fully to that endeavour.',\n",
       " 'I welcome everyone to New York. It is a profound honour to stand here in my home city as a representative of the American people to address the people of the world.\\nAs millions of our citizens continue to suffer the effects of the devastating hurricanes that have struck our country, I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in the Hall who has offered assistance and aid. The American people are strong and resilient, and they will emerge from these hardships more determined than ever before.\\nFortunately, the United States of America has done very well since election day, last 8 November. The stock market is at an all-time high. That is a record. Unemployment is at its lowest level in 16 years, and because of our regulatory and other reforms, we have more people working in the United States today than ever before. Companies are moving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time, and it has just been announced that we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and defence. Our military will soon be the strongest it has ever been.\\nFor more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of nations, movements and religions have stood before the Assembly. Like them, I intend to address some of the very serious threats before us today, but also the enormous potential waiting to be unleashed. We live in a time of extraordinary opportunity. Breakthroughs in science, technology and medicine are curing illnesses and solving problems that prior generations thought impossible to solve.\\nBut each day also brings news of growing dangers that threaten everything we cherish and value. Terrorists and extremists have gathered strength and spread to every region of the planet. Rogue regimes represented in this organ not only support terrorists, but threaten other nations and their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humankind. Authoritarian Powers seek to collapse the values, systems and alliances that have prevented conflict and tilted the world towards freedom since the Second World War. International criminal networks traffic drugs, weapons and people; force dislocation and mass migration; and threaten our borders. New forms of aggression exploit technology to menace our citizens.\\nTo put it simply, we meet at a time of both immense promise and great peril. It is entirely up to us whether we lift the world to new heights or let it fall into a valley of disrepair. We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions from poverty, to help citizens realize their dreams and to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence, hatred and fear.\\nThis institution was founded in the aftermath of two world wars to help shape this better future. It is based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security and promote their prosperity. It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe, based on the three beautiful pillars of peace, sovereignty and security, and prosperity. The Marshall Plan was built on the noble idea that the whole world is safer when nations are strong, independent and free. As President Truman said in his message to Congress at that time, “Our support of European recovery is in full accord with our support of the United Nations”.\\nThe success of the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its Members. To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of the future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past. Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity and peace for themselves and for the world.\\nWe do not expect diverse countries to share the same cultures, traditions or even systems of Government, but we do expect all nations to uphold the two core sovereign duties to respect the interests of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation. That is the beautiful vision of this institution, and it is the foundation for cooperation and success. Strong sovereign nations let diverse countries with different values, different cultures and different dreams not just coexist but work side by side on the basis of mutual respect. Strong sovereign nations let their people take ownership of the future and control their own destiny. Strong, sovereign nations allow individuals to flourish in the fullness of the life intended by God.\\nIn America, we seek not to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch. This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in that example. We are celebrating the 230th anniversary of our beloved Constitution, the oldest constitution still in use in the world today. That timeless document has been the foundation of peace, prosperity and freedom for the Americans and for countless millions around the globe whose own countries have found inspiration in its respect for human nature, human dignity and the rule of law. The greatest part of the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words. They are “We the people”. Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of those words, the promise of our country and of our great history. In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people are sovereign.\\nI was elected not to take power but to give power to the American people, where it belongs. In foreign affairs, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty. Our Government’s first duty is to its people, to our citizens; to serve their needs, to ensure their safety, to preserve their rights and to defend their values. As President of the United States, I will always put America first, just as the leaders of the countries present will always and should always put their countries first. All responsible leaders have an obligation to serve their own citizens, and the nation State remains the best vehicle for elevating the human condition. But making a better life for our people also requires us to work together in close harmony and unity to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people. The United States will forever be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies, but we can no longer be taken advantage of or enter into one-sided deals where the United States gets nothing in return.\\nAs long as I hold my office, I will defend America’s interest above all else; but in fulfilling our obligations to our own nations, we also realize that it is in everyone’s interest to seek a future where all nations can be sovereign, prosperous and secure. America does more than speak for the values expressed in the Charter of the United Nations. Our citizens have paid the ultimate price to defend our freedom and the freedom of many nations represented in this great Hall. America’s devotion is measured on the battlefields where our young men and women have fought and sacrificed alongside our allies. From the beaches of Europe, to the deserts of the Middle East, to the jungles of Asia, it is an eternal credit to the American character that even after we and our allies emerged victorious from the bloodiest war in history, we did not seek territorial expansion or attempt to oppose and impose our way of life on others. Instead we helped to build institutions such as this one to defend the sovereignty, security and prosperity of all.\\nFor the diverse nations of the world, this is our hope. We want harmony and friendship, not conflict and strife. We are guided by outcomes, not ideology. We have a policy of principled realism rooted in shared goals, interests and values. That realism forces us to confront a question facing every leader and nation in the Hall. It is a question we cannot escape or avoid. Will we slide down the path of complacency, numb to the challenges, threats and even wars that we face, or do we have enough strength and pride to confront those dangers today so that our citizens can enjoy peace and prosperity tomorrow?\\nIf we desire to lift up our citizens, if we aspire to the approval of history, then we must fulfil our sovereign duties to the people we faithfully represent. We must protect our nations, their interests and their futures. We must reject threats to sovereignty, from Ukraine to the South China Sea. We must uphold respect for law, respect for borders and respect for culture and the peaceful engagement these allow. And, just as the founders of this organ intended, we must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos, turmoil and terror.\\nThe scourge of our planet today is a small group of rogue regimes that violate every principle on which the United Nations is based. They respect neither their own citizens nor the sovereign rights of their countries. If the righteous many do not confront the wicked few, then evil will triumph. When decent people and nations become bystanders to history, the forces of destruction only gather power and strength.\\nNo one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the well-being of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea. It is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of North Koreans and for the imprisonment, torture, killing and oppression of countless more. We were all witness to the regime’s deadly abuse when an innocent American college student, Otto Warmbier, was returned to America only to die a few days later. We saw it in the assassination of the dictator’s brother, using banned nerve agents in an international airport. We know it kidnapped a sweet 13-year-old Japanese girl from a beach in her own country to enslave her as a language tutor for North Korea’s spies.\\nIf that were not twisted enough, now North Korea’s reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles threatens the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life. It is an outrage that some nations would not only trade with such a regime, but would arm, supply and financially support a country that imperils the world with nuclear conflict. No nation on Earth has an interest in seeing this band of criminals arm itself with nuclear weapons and missiles. The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. Rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime. The United States is ready, willing and able but, hopefully, that will not be necessary. That is what the United Nations is all about. That is what the United Nations is for. Let us see how they do.\\nIt is time for North Korea to realize that denuclearization is its only acceptable future. The Security Council recently held two unanimous 15-to-nothing votes, adopting hard-hitting resolutions against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. I would like to thank China and Russia for joining the vote to impose sanctions, along with all of the other members of the Security Council. I thank all who were involved, but we must do much more. It is time for all nations to work together to isolate the Kim regime until it ceases its hostile behaviour.\\nWe face that decision not only in North Korea. It is far past time for the nations of the world to confront another reckless regime — one that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing death to America, destruction to Israel and ruin for many leaders and nations represented in the Hall today. The Iranian Government masks a corrupt dictatorship behind the false guise of a democracy. It has turned a wealthy country with a rich history and culture into an economically depleted rogue State whose chief exports are violence, bloodshed and chaos. The longest-suffering victims of Iran’s leaders are in fact its own people. Rather than use its resources to improve Iranian lives, its oil profits go to fund Hizbullah and other terrorists who kill innocent Muslims and attack their peaceful Arab and Israeli neighbours.\\nThat wealth, which rightly belongs to Iran’s people, also goes to shore up Bashar Al-Assad’s dictatorship, fuel Yemen’s civil war and undermine peace throughout the entire Middle East. We cannot let a murderous regime continue such destabilizing activities, while building dangerous missiles. And we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear programme.\\nThe Iran deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into. Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States — and I do not think that the Assembly has heard the last of it, believe me. It is time for the entire world to join us in demanding that Iran’s Government end its pursuit of death and destruction. It is time for the regime to free all the Americans and citizens of other nations whom they have unjustly detained. Above all, Iran’s Government must stop supporting terrorists, begin serving its own people and respect the sovereign rights of its neighbours.\\nThe entire world understands that the good people of Iran want change and, other than the vast military power of the United States, that Iran’s people are what their leaders fear the most. That is what causes the regime to restrict Internet access, tear down satellite dishes, shoot unarmed student protesters and imprison political reformers. Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the people will face a choice. Will they continue down the path of poverty, bloodshed and terror, or will the Iranian people return to the nation’s proud roots as a centre of civilization, culture and wealth, where people can be happy and prosperous once again?\\nThe Iranian regime’s support for terror is in stark contrast to the recent commitments of many of its neighbours to fight terrorism and halt its financing. In Saudi Arabia, early last year, I was greatly honoured to address the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations. We agree that all responsible nations must work together to confront terrorists and the Islamic extremism that inspires them. We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow it to tear up our nation and, indeed, to tear up the entire world.\\nWe must deny terrorists safe haven, transit, funding and any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology. We must drive them out of our nations. It is time to expose and hold responsible those countries that support and finance terror groups, such as Al-Qaida, Hizbullah, the Taliban and others that slaughter innocent people. The United States and its allies are working together throughout the Middle East to crush loser terrorists and stop the re-emergence of the safe havens they use to launch attacks on all of our people.\\nLast month, I announced a new strategy for victory in the fight against that evil in Afghanistan. From now on, our security interests — not the arbitrary benchmarks and timetables set up by politicians — will dictate the length and scope of military operations. I have also totally changed the rules of engagement in our fight against the Taliban and other terrorist groups. In Syria and Iraq, we have made big gains towards lasting defeat of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS). In fact, our country has achieved more against ISIS in the last eight months than it has in many years combined.\\nWe seek the de-escalation of the Syrian conflict and a political solution that honours the will of the Syrian people. The actions of the criminal regime of Bashar Al-Assad, including the use of chemical weapons against his own citizens, even innocent children, shocked the conscience of every decent person. No society can be safe if banned chemical weapons are allowed to spread. That is why the United States carried out a missile strike on the air base that launched the attack. We appreciate the efforts of the United Nations agencies that are providing vital humanitarian assistance in the areas liberated from ISIS. We especially thank Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon for their role in hosting refugees from the Syrian conflict.\\nThe United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of dollars to help support that effort. We seek an approach to refugee resettlement that is designed to help those horribly treated and enable their eventual return to their home countries to be part of the rebuilding process. For the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region. Out of the goodness of our hearts, we offer financial assistance to host countries in the region and we support the recent agreements of the Group of 20 nations that will seek to host refugees as close to their home countries as possible.\\nThat is the safe, responsible and humanitarian approach. For decades, the United States has dealt with migration challenges here in the western hemisphere. We have learned that, over the long term, uncontrolled migration is deeply unfair to both the sending and the receiving countries. For the sending countries, it reduces domestic pressure to pursue needed political and economic reforms and drains them of the human capital necessary to motivate and implement those reforms. For the receiving countries, the substantial costs of uncontrolled migration are borne overwhelmingly by low-income citizens, whose concerns are often ignored by both media and Government.\\nI want to salute the work of the United Nations in seeking to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. The United Nations- and the African Union-led peacekeeping missions have made invaluable contributions in stabilizing conflicts in Africa.\\nThe United States continues to lead the world in humanitarian assistance, including famine prevention and relief in South Sudan, Somalia, northern Nigeria and Yemen. We have invested in better health and opportunity all over the world through programmes like the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the President’s Malaria Initiative, the Global Health Security Agenda, the Global Fund to End Modern Slavery, and the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative, which is part of our commitment to empowering women all across the globe.\\nWe also thank the Secretary-General for recognizing that the United Nations must reform if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty, security and prosperity. Too often the focus of the Organization has not been on results, but on bureaucracy and process. In some cases, States that seek to subvert this institution’s noble ends have hijacked the very systems that are supposed to advance them. For example, it is a massive source of embarrassment to the United Nations that some Governments with egregious human rights records sit on the United Nations Human Rights Council.\\nThe United States is one of 193 countries in the United Nations, and yet we pay 22 per cent of the entire budget and more. In fact, we pay far more than anybody realizes. The United States bears an unfair cost burden, but, to be fair, if it could actually accomplish all of its stated goals, especially the goal of peace, this investment would easily be well worth it.\\nMajor portions of the world are in conflict, and some in fact are going to hell, but the powerful people in this Hall, under the guidance and auspices of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems. The American people hope that one day soon the United Nations can be a much more accountable and effective advocate for human dignity and freedom around the world. In the meantime, we believe that no nation should have to bear a disproportionate share of the burden — militarily or financially.\\nNations of the world must take a greater role in promoting secure and prosperous societies in their own regions. That is why, in the western hemisphere, the United States has stood against the corrupt destabilizing regime in Cuba and embraced the enduring dream of the Cuban people to live in freedom. My Administration recently announced that we will not lift sanctions on the Cuban Government until it makes fundamental reforms.\\nWe have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the socialist Maduro regime in Venezuela, which has brought a once-thriving nation to the brink of total collapse. The socialist dictatorship of Nicolás Maduro Moros has inflicted terrible pain and suffering on the good people of that country. This corrupt regime destroyed a prosperous nation by imposing a failed ideology that has produced poverty and misery everywhere it has been tried. To make matters worse, Maduro has defied his own people, stealing power from their elected representatives to preserve his disastrous rule.\\nThe Venezuelan people are starving, and their country is collapsing. Their democratic institutions are being destroyed. This situation is completely unacceptable, and we cannot stand by and watch. As a responsible neighbour and friend, we, together with all others, have a goal: to help them regain their freedom, recover their country and restore their democracy.\\nI would like to thank leaders in this Hall for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the Venezuelan people. The United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable. We are prepared to take further action if the Government of Venezuela persists on its path to impose authoritarian rule on the Venezuelan people.\\nWe are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today. Our economic bond forms a critical foundation for advancing peace and prosperity for all of our peoples and all of our neighbours. I ask every country represented here today to be prepared to do more to address this very real crisis. We call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela.\\nThe problem in Venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented, but that socialism has been faithfully implemented. From the Soviet Union to Cuba to Venezuela, wherever true socialism or communism has been adopted, it has delivered anguish and devastation and failure. Those who preach the tenets of those discredited ideologies only contribute to the continued suffering of the people who live under those cruel systems. America stands with every person living under a brutal regime. Our respect for sovereignty is also a call for action.\\nAll people deserve a Government that cares for their safety, their interests and their well-being, including their prosperity. In America, we seek stronger ties of business and trade with all nations of goodwill, but that trade must be fair and it must be reciprocal. For too long the American people were told that mammoth multinational trade deals, unaccountable international tribunals and powerful global bureaucracies were the best way to promote their success. But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of factories disappeared. Others gamed the system and broke the rules, and our great middle class, once the bedrock of American prosperity, was forgotten and left behind. But they are forgotten no more, and they will never be forgotten again.\\nWhile America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing our commitment to the first duty of every Government: the duty to our citizens. This bond is the source of America’s strength and that of every responsible nation represented here today. If the Organization is to have any hope of successfully confronting the challenges before us, it will depend, as President Truman said some 70 years ago, on the independent strength of its Members. If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and overcome the present dangers together, there can be no substitute for strong, sovereign and independent nations, nations that are rooted in their histories and invested in their destinies; nations that seek allies to befriend, not enemies to conquer; and most important of all, nations that are home to patriots, to men and women who are willing to sacrifice for their countries, their fellow citizens and for all that is best in the human spirit.\\nIn remembering the great victory that led to this body’s founding, we must never forget that those heroes who fought against evil also fought for the nations that they love. Patriotism led the Poles to die to save Poland, the French to fight for a free France and the Brits to stand strong for Britain. Today if we do not invest ourselves, our hearts and our minds in our nations, if we will not build strong families, safe communities and healthy societies for ourselves, no one can do it for us. We cannot wait for someone else, for faraway countries or far-off bureaucracies. We cannot do it.\\nWe must solve our problems to build our prosperity, to secure our future, or we will be vulnerable to decay, domination and defeat. The true question for the United Nations today, for people all over the world who hope for better lives for themselves and their children is a basic one: are we still patriots? Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take ownership of their futures? Do we revere them enough to defend their interests, preserve their cultures and ensure a peaceful world for their citizens?\\nOne of the greatest American patriots, John Adams, wrote that the American Revolution was effected before the war commenced. The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people. That was the moment when America awoke, when we looked around and understood that we were a nation. We realized who we were, what we valued and what we would give our lives to defend. From its very first moments, the American story is the story of what is possible when people take ownership of their future. The United States of America has been among the greatest forces for good in the history of the world and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security and prosperity for all.\\nNow we are calling for a great reawakening of nations, for the revival of their spirits, their pride, their people and their patriotism. History is asking us whether we are up to the task. Our answer will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve and a rebirth of devotion. We need to defeat the enemies of humankind and unlock the potential of life itself. Our hope is a word and a world of proud, independent nations that embrace their duties, seek friendship, respect others and make common cause in the greatest shared interest of all, a future of dignity and peace for the people of this wonderful Earth. This is the true vision of the United Nations, the ancient wish of every people and the deepest yearning that lives inside every sacred soul.\\nSo let this be our mission and let this be our message to the world: we will fight together, sacrifice together and stand together for peace, for freedom, for justice, for family, for humankind and for the Almighty God who made us all.\\nGod bless the nations of the world and God bless the United States of America.',\n",
       " 'I believe we should appreciate the fact that the theme of this year’s general debate deals with global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies. It is comprehensive and provides food for thought on the direction in which our world should develop — and this international Organization along with it.\\nGlobal leadership is, first and foremost, a great responsibility. In order for us to achieve sustainability and standards  of  living  that  uphold  the   principle of dignity for every human being on the planet, it is absolutely crucial that we demonstrate our commitment and unity as we face the challenges of our time. I am convinced that we are all aware that we need to act with determination and unity in sharing the responsibility to ensure peace, equality and the  sustainability  of our communities.\\nThe Republic of Bulgaria has worked constantly and actively to sustain a world order based on the rule of law and to reaffirm the principles of multilateral cooperation. That is why I would like to highlight that it is the destiny of the United Nations to play a central role in that effort, and we therefore actively support the Organization in its efforts.\\n \\nThe main global challenges, such as conflict resolution and peacekeeping, strengthening global security and stability, countering climate change, terrorism and ever-deepening inequality, cannot be addressed by one country alone. Those challenges require shared responsibility and everyone’s contribution.\\nGlobal peace and security depend on the stability and sustainable development of the various parts of our globalized world. Every country, large or small, has the responsibility and capacity to make a significant contribution to security and prosperity in the region in which it is located. For example, this past Monday, at the high-level event on the global drug problem organized by President Trump, every participating country made a firm commitment to fighting that global scourge. It was not by chance that Bulgaria was one of the co-hosts of that event. We have already pledged and proven our commitment to fighting the drug problem  through our actions. Even as we speak, Bulgarian customs authorities and prosecutors have managed to seize hundreds of kilogrammes of drugs, making my country a positive example. In order to achieve peace, security and stability, as well as the Sustainable Development Goals, we all need to take more actions of that kind.\\nThe United Nations plays an integral part in promoting the fair use of global opportunities for the benefit of all. Inclusive and sustainable global growth underpins the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, which are universal in nature and closely interlinked, is the key to addressing our current global challenges.\\nDuring the first half of this year, the Bulgarian presidency of the Council of the European Union (EU) invested considerable efforts in achieving marked progress and consensus among member States on the main goals of the 2030 Agenda. We are proud that during our six-month tenure of the presidency, the European Union adopted a mandate to start negotiations for the signing of a new partnership agreement with 79 countries from Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific. The negotiations seek to achieve a modern, dynamic partnership with those countries as an important instrument in tackling global challenges, ranging from poverty and inequality to the promotion of peace and sustainable development for all.\\nAllow me to highlight some of the idiosyncrasies of the region in which my country, Bulgaria, is situated.\\nThis year we mark the 100th anniversary of the end of the First World War, which serves to remind us of the importance of the Balkans in the past as well as the relevance of the region in the present day. The Balkans have often been the source of conflicts and to this day the embers of some in that area continue to burn.\\nDespite the circumstances and obstacles they face, the countries of South-Eastern Europe, especially those in the Western Balkans, have managed to make remarkable progress on important and much debated issues. It took several decades to reach the current state of affairs, which is why we should not hesitate any further to offer the international community’s unequivocal political support to every State or initiative that deserves support.\\nCompelling proof of the progress made by the Western Balkan countries can be seen in the recent signing of agreements  between  Sofia  and  Skopje,  as well as that between Athens and Skopje. Those agreements are crucial steps towards stability and security in South-Eastern Europe and towards the Euro- Atlantic prospects of the Western Balkan countries. The agreement between Podgorica and  Pristina  on the border demarcation, which just came into force, is also a significant milestone. Those documents not only show but also help to create the new spirit of relations between and among the countries of that region.\\nI will provide one more example. Based on the historic opportunity that the rotating presidency  of the Council of the EU offered us, Bulgaria initiated a process that put the Western Balkans back on the agenda of European politics. Opportunities for cooperation and the participation of countries from outside the region in the construction of the new Balkan infrastructure have already started to attract interest and investments.\\nAn  important  and emblematic  expression  of that process was the Leaders’ Summit of the States members of the EU and the Western Balkan countries in our capital, Sofia, in May this year. That was the first meeting of its kind since the Thessaloniki Summit in 2003. Connectivity in all its dimensions was the focus of the discussion, as was the joint response of the young and relatively small Balkan States to the common challenges to security that we all face, such as irregular migration, organized crime, terrorism, hybrid threats, cybersecurity and misinformation. The Sofia Declaration adopted at the Summit reaffirmed the\\n \\nEuropean prospects for the region and made them an achievable goal.\\nWe are aware that that is just the beginning of a new path that is encouraging but neither easy nor quick. However, the stakes are high, not only for the citizens of those countries and for their EU neighbours and friends, but also for the global processes aimed at economic and political strengthening and development. We cannot leave blank spots marked by lagging development, weak economies and societies susceptible to the present global threats.\\nIn two days’ time, the citizens of  our neighbour  to the south-east, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, will have to take a landmark decision about their future — whether to endorse the unprecedented compromise achieved with neighbouring Greece, which will clear their path towards Euro-Atlantic integration. It is a truly historic moment and shows exactly why we should support the citizens of that country as they take that new decision for their country.\\nTwo of our other neighbours face a very difficult dilemma. We support the dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina, and we welcome their determination to move forward in normalizing bilateral relations with the help of EU mediation. At the same time, we deem the potential re-tailoring of borders a non-viable solution, not just in this case but in general.\\nImportant elections for Bosnia and Herzegovina are coming up in October. They will serve as a key test of the country’s unity and determination to progress further along the path of European integration. As we can see, the situation in that part of Europe is very dynamic and fraught with important events that for many years to come will determine the direction of the region’s development and, to a large extent, the state  of the EU. What we have  managed to achieve so  far as a result of our work within the main priorities of Bulgarian foreign policy is part of our contribution to peace and security on the European continent and the world beyond.\\nHowever, the generally optimistic prospects for the Western Balkans and South-Eastern Europea are in drastic contrast to the conflicts that surround them on three sides — in Ukraine to the north-east, in the Middle East to the south-east and in Libya to the south. Migration flows and the increasing threat of terrorism are the direct consequences of conflicts around the world. I will address those topics in due course.\\nFirst, I would like to draw the Assembly’s attention to the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine. In the past four and a half years, according to data from the United Nations, the total number of victims in the conflict has exceeded 10,000, and the number of wounded stands  at 24,000. There is special cause for concern about the deteriorating humanitarian and environmental situation in Donbas. In addition to such dire statistics,  there has been no real progress in implementing the Minsk agreements, which, in our view, represent the only way to a peaceful and sustainable solution to the conflict. The existing differences with regard to the deployment of international peacekeeping forces in eastern Ukraine under the auspices of the United Nations continue. We, the leaders of the States Members of this international Organization, share the responsibility to establish a peaceful, fair and sustainable world order that rests on the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. I call on the Assembly to redouble its efforts to achieve peace and stability in Ukraine without infringing on its sovereignty and territorial integrity.\\nThe situation in Syria remains  tragic.  Despite  the efforts of the international community, military activities in the country continue, resulting in increasing numbers of casualties among the civilian population, as well as thousands of new migrants. As a country that is geographically close to Syria, Bulgaria supports efforts to prevent any further escalation of the military conflict. To that end, we support the continuation of political dialogue and intra-Syria negotiations, with the aim of finding a permanent political solution to  the crisis.\\nWe support the launch of international initiatives to create conditions that are conducive to restarting the Middle East peace process through bilateral talks. We believe that that is the way to achieve a final agreement, based on the principle of two States coexisting in peace and stability. That is why we greatly appreciate and strongly support the efforts of Nickolay Mladenov, the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process, to improve the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip as soon as possible.\\nWith regard to Libya, Bulgaria supports the United Nations Action Plan for Libya and the efforts  of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya, whose primary task is to stabilize the country and reach national conciliation in the context of the existing political and institutional fragmentation. We support\\n \\nthe agreement reached by the four key political leaders for conducting presidential and parliamentary elections.\\nIt is impossible to end all conflicts, but I would nevertheless like to say a few words about another important issue related to peace and security in the world, especially after some of the  statements  we have heard from Mr.  Abbas,  Mr.  Netanyahu  and  Mr. Rouhani. We are of the opinion that in the current context, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on  the Iranian nuclear programme continues to be a key element in the international  security  architecture. We also support all efforts for the full, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and the establishment of permanent peace in North- East Asia.\\nMigration flows and refugee crises are a global phenomenon, the result of a myriad political and socioeconomic factors, and of conflicts in various parts of the world in particular. Let me underscore clearly and right from the start that irregular migration is a serious challenge to our societies’ security and stability. That is why we need to strengthen cooperation among all the countries concerned, including countries of origin, transit and destination, in order to reach a sustainable and permanent solution. It must fully guarantee human rights and the sovereign right of States to ensure the security of their borders.\\nThe efforts of the international community should focus chiefly on the main causes of migration, which are political, socioeconomic and natural —  that  is, the result of natural disasters. We should pay special attention to the various dimensions of development and the integral link between development and security. However, if we do not support those efforts with active mediation and peacekeeping and do not manage to resolve current conflicts and prevent future ones, our chances for success are doomed. That is where I see the crucial and unique role of the United Nations, which can and should be strengthened if there is sufficient political will on the part of Member States.\\nDuring its presidency of the Council of the European Union, Bulgaria took an active part in the process of negotiating the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration. Finalizing the language of the compact is an achievement based on multilateral cooperation, and I am confident that its adoption at  the Intergovernmental Conference in Morocco in December will lay the groundwork for the successful\\nimplementation of the first-ever global framework for cooperation in the area of international migration.\\nWe in Bulgaria also welcome the completion  of the consultations on the text of the global compact on refugees, which constitutes a comprehensive response to the problem of large-scale migration flows, based on the principle of shared responsibility. We have recently seen an increase in the numbers of terrorist attacks all over  the world, as well  as in the number   of innocent victims of terrorism. Irregular migration waves have enabled the infiltration of our countries and communities by former fighters from Syria,  Iraq, Afghanistan and other places, including trained members of terrorist organizations, such as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant and Al-Qaida.\\nBulgaria categorically condemns all forms and expressions of terrorism, no matter what cause they claim to support. They undermine peace, security and the social and economic development of States. That  is why an effective response to the problem requires the coordinated efforts of the entire international community. That is also why we support the United Nations in its capacity as a  universal  organization that possesses the full range of instruments to  lead and coordinate the process, along with facilitating the exchange of experience among regional organizations and national agencies and assisting in streamlining their efforts.\\nWe support the work of the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism and the specific steps taken to intensify the Organization’s operations in that regard, including support for the organization of the High-level Conference of Heads of Counter-Terrorism Agencies of Member States. One priority is taking measures to protect young people from being radicalized or joining terrorist groups, as well as to neutralize the influence of persons and organizations instigating terrorist attacks.\\nThis year we mark the seventieth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and for the first time  Bulgaria  will  present its candidacy for membership of the Human Rights Council. We rely on the support of Member States. That is not an end in itself for us but  rather an expression of our consistent policy of working for the protection and affirmation of human rights in Bulgaria and at  the global level. Our presidency of the Council of the European Union also gave  Bulgaria the  opportunity to showcase its contribution to various aspects of the\\n \\nprotection of human rights. We intend to continue to share our best practices as a member of the Human Rights Council. The values that give meaning to any political effort subsume the past, the present and the future. That is also what allows us to better comprehend and appreciate our present efforts.\\nThere is a moment in Bulgaria’s history of which we Bulgarians are justifiably proud. Seventy-five years ago, in some of the darkest years of the Second World War, Bulgaria’s citizens, Church and enlightened leaders and intellectuals stood up to attempts to deport nearly 50,000 Bulgarian Jews to the death camps. They managed to prevent that from happening. Bulgarians achieved that at a time when Nazi Germany had subordinated and occupied almost all of Europe. Bulgaria is proud of the people who managed to save nearly 50,000 Jews.\\nI share the story about the saving of Bulgarian Jews because it carries a very strong message that is relevant to the present day and to all who feel threatened. It shows that humaneness and courage can triumph over power and irrationality and save lives. It reminds us that we should never stop fighting for human life and the right causes. The salvation of the Bulgarian Jews is a much-needed example that can reassure us that values are not a forgotten notion but offer a chance for a better future.\\nThe Bulgarian example should become more widely known to more people so that it can give courage to others around the world who are fighting to defend their lives and those lives of others and to protect dignity and human rights. It is our mission at present not to allow xenophobia and anti-Semitism to return or to permit a disregard for the right to live based on race, ethnicity or other factors. We Bulgarians know that it is possible and that it has happened before.\\nOur main task is to guarantee peace and prosperity around the world. I am convinced that that is attainable, not through arms or battles but rather through a greater sense of humanity and responsibility. We also need more than ever to strengthen the  role  and  authority of the United Nations in its global operations. I am confident that, with effort and good will on  the part of all Member States, that grand goal can be achieved.\\n',\n",
       " 'Twenty years ago, in this very Hall, Kofi Annan set out the three great challenges facing the international community at the time: first, the challenge of security and the need to replace the post-Cold War world order with a new one, governed by peace and freedom; secondly, the challenge of development and the need  to ensure that globalization benefited all peoples and countries, leaving no one behind; thirdly, the challenge of human rights and the rule of law, and the need to protect the dignity of all without distinction as to race, colour, gender, language or any other discriminatory factor (see A/53/PV.7).\\nTwenty years have now gone by, and the challenges bequeathed to us by Kofi Annan — security, development and human rights — remain just as important and are still key challenges to our world order. These challenges, of course, come under new guises and take on various forms. We are no longer divided by the mistrust, fear and prejudice that were the legacy of the walls and iron curtains that emerged in the wake of the Second World War. The truth is that many factors unite us in terms of human dignity and freedoms, and we are connected by a knowledge- and information-based society that has enabled those who embrace it to reap the benefits but is indifferent and cruel to those who turn their back to it. We are living at a time of vast global transformation, which means the emergence of tremendous new opportunities as well as major new dangers.\\nSome believed that the end of the Cold War also meant the end of history, and that we had at last found our way and were approaching an era of peace, freedom and prosperity, based on democracy and the social\\nmarket economy. However, history will never meet its end as long as there are still free men and women who think for themselves. Accordingly, a new world order has emerged that has given rise to new divisions and tensions in many parts of the world. States are no longer the only main players in international relations.\\nIn the area of security, we have not yet been able  to overcome serious threats to international  peace  and security such as terrorism, drug trafficking, armed conflict, organized crime, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and illicit trafficking in weapons and persons. Furthermore, as never before, today we are compelled to face one of the biggest challenges resulting from these threats to international peace and security — large-scale migration around  the world, which is a significant challenge for the entire international community. We are aware of its causes — terrorism, war, ethnic and religious conflict, hunger and totalitarian regimes, all of which have recently caused the largest displacement of people in the history of humankind. The figures are stark and speak for themselves. There are currently 260 million people who have had to leave their countries of origin. Every year more than 1.3 million people abandon their countries for the reasons I have mentioned.\\nIn the light of that situation, Chile’s commitment is categorical and clear. We are designing a safe, orderly and regular migration policy, in line with the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants and the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, which raise the need to establish migration policies that guarantee safe, orderly and regular migration. We want to receive and welcome all who enter Chile seeking new and better lives, who do so with the intention of obeying our laws, committing to the development of our country and to integrating into our society. With equal strength and conviction, however, we want to keep  order  in our country and bar those who enter illegally, break our laws, come to commit crimes or have committed serious crimes in their countries of origin. By doing so we can prevent and impede the entry of drug traffickers and people involved in organized crime, because all Presidents and Heads of State and Government are responsible for their citizens’ safety, which is of course a key concern for any Government.\\nOur migration policy seeks to strike a balance between the State’s sovereign right to regulate the manner in which migrants enter and remain in our country, on the one hand, and its duty to respect\\n \\nand guarantee the fundamental rights and duties of migrants, on the other, by putting a stop to irregular immigration, punishing criminal acts and welcoming those who come to integrate legally into our societies in accordance with the law.\\nThe second great challenge is development. Six months ago, when I  embarked  on  my  second  term as President of Chile, I pledged to undertake a great mission — transforming Chile into a developed country without poverty and with greater equality of opportunity and solidarity by the end of the next decade. Genuine development is much more than economic growth. We are therefore talking about comprehensive development that encompasses all aspects of our lives, an inclusive development that reaches all families, individuals and regions, and a sustainable development that protects and is in aligned with nature and the environment. That is the genuine development that all peoples and countries need and that we almost all ratified through our previous commitment to the Millennium Development Goals and now through the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and the 2030 Agenda  for  Sustainable  Development, to which we are committed under the auspices of the United Nations.\\nFor that reason, the importance of defending and strengthening multilateralism and free trade, to which many have alluded this week, is now severely under threats from such things as trade and tariff wars, the consequences of which we felt as long ago as the Great Depression of the previous century. The economic dimension is, of course, very important. More than ever, we need to promote and bolster an international system that is predictable and based on clear and agreed standards, fosters free trade and enables mechanisms for settling disputes peacefully rather than through conflict, confrontation or tariff wars.\\nHowever, we must also think about creating a culture and an international community that are built on the principles and values of freedom, human dignity, full respect for human rights, gender equality and the fight against climate change and other new emerging threats, such as those related to cyberspace.\\nSuch comprehensive, inclusive and sustainable development compels us to implement robust measures aimed at ensuring full equality in terms of rights, dignity and opportunities for both women  and  men, as well as a culture of zero tolerance for violence or discrimination against women. Our true development\\ncan be measured by the way in which we treat our societies’ most vulnerable members, such as children, women, elderly people, those suffering from disease and the poorest. In many of  those  areas,  many  of our countries still have a long way to go.\\nToday our planet faces major threats and challenges, such as a deteriorating environment, global warming, growing desertification, the destruction of the ozone layer, the depletion of natural resources, the loss of biodiversity, as well as air, water and soil pollution and deforestation, to name just a few.\\nSome time ago, major and well-regarded magazines published photographs of the Earth with the caption “Save planet Earth”. But  that should not  be our greatest concern. Planet Earth has existed for more than 4 billion years and has survived all kinds  of catastrophes — flooding, glaciation, warming and earthquakes. What is actually at risk is the survival of the human race on planet Earth. During its long history, 99 out of every 100 species that have ever existed have now disappeared. Naturally, we do not want to add human beings to that sad list of extinct species.\\nWe know that the environment is changing and that global warming is occurring faster than our efforts to understand, halt and stop it. The alarm bells continue to sound and our citizens continue to march, and we cannot claim to be ignorant about it. We have  a  duty to respond immediately to nature’s desperate cries for protection, so that in turn it can protect us. There is  no time to lose and no reason to procrastinate about this, because time is no longer our ally. It is our enemy. Our generation’s response to this great challenge will undoubtedly be judged by our children, grandchildren and other generations to come. The threat of climate change and the way we address it will define this and future centuries and requires a vast multilateral effort. We are aware that we are dealing with a truly serious, urgent and growing threat that we can no longer ignore, delay or downplay.\\nNo nation is immune  to  that  threat,  but  Chile  is especially vulnerable. My country is a veritable observatory and natural laboratory, as it contains very diverse land, maritime, coastal and glacial ecosystems, among many others, as well as unique island ecosystems that are home to more than 30,000 species of plants, animals, fungi and bacteria. In addition, Chile is geographically unique because of its natural barriers, the Andes range to the east, the Pacific Ocean to the\\n \\nwest, the Atacama desert to the north and the Antarctic to the south, which means that we are home to species found nowhere else in the world. For example, almost 90 per cent of fish species — the highest percentage  in the world — on Robinson Crusoe Island in the Juan Fernández archipelago are endemic; in other words, they are unique to that environment.\\nHowever, that virtue is also our Achilles heel. Chile, as a natural observatory, is greatly exposed to the risks and threats of climate change  and  global  warming. In fact, seven of the nine major vulnerability factors listed in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change apply to Chile — low-lying coastal areas, arid and semi-arid areas, large forested areas, areas prone to natural disasters, areas prone to drought and desertification, urban areas with atmospheric pollution problems, and mountainous ecosystems.\\nThat compels us to seek urgent and effective solutions in order to adapt to and address the threat of global warming. As President of Chile, I am especially committed to sustainable development, in other words, environmentally friendly development that respects nature. A threat that was once remote is  now  upon  us, and we are currently witnessing the lethal impact of those changes and their possible future impact on present and future generations. There is no time to lose. We must take the bull by the horns and do whatever is necessary to change the course of history.\\nWhat has Chile done in that regard? First, we are committed to creating protected areas that preserve crucial biodiversity. Chile has been a regional and world leader in creating protected areas since the beginning of the last century, starting with the Malleco National Reserve. Today, there are 180 marine and land-protected areas in Chile covering more than 120 million hectares.\\nWe are also firmly committed to conserving our oceans, their biodiversity and the sustainable use of their resources. We  have  already protected more than\\n13 per cent of our exclusive economic zone, which stretches along Chile’s approximately 4,200 kilometres of coastline. And we are on our way to achieving 40 per cent protection, with the largest marine protected area in Latin America, one of the largest in the world, on wondrous Easter Island, or Rapa Nui.\\nIn addition, the energy path that we are following towards a cleaner, safer, more cost-effective and more diversified energy matrix that strongly promotes decarbonization has enabled us to make significant\\nheadway in developing clean, renewable energy, particularly volcanic energy — Chile has 25 per cent of the world’s active volcanoes — as well as wind and solar energy, since Chile is home to a desert with the highest solar radiation levels in the world. We are also making great advances in removing fossil fuels from our transport system and moving towards electromobility, with a more definitive solution that is more compatible with those objectives.\\nMoreover, we are addressing the threat to our planet posed by plastic. We understand how important it is for all Governments to act in time to prevent 12 billion tons — a figure we have almost reached — of plastic waste from ending up in natural environments, meaning that there would be more plastic bags than fish in our oceans. I am very happy that the first piece of legislation to be adopted during my current term in office has banned the use of plastic bags in Chilean shops. Chile is the first country in Latin America to restrict the free distribution of any kind of single-use plastic bag. The fact is that one plastic bag takes seconds to produce and is used, on average, for 15 minutes on the journey back from the supermarket, but then takes 400 years to biodegrade, which means that for a few minutes of use, nature and humankind must suffer the harmful effects of one plastic bag for more than 400 years.\\nOnce and for all, we must address many of those problems with a new attitude and abandon the idea that the goals of economic growth and the protection of the environment are incompatible. The fact is that if growth is unsustainable, it will simply cease to exist. We must also abandon our throwaway culture and return to embracing one of recycling.\\nPollution has struck very dramatically and close to home in my country, Chile. Over the past few weeks, the two communes of Puchuncaví and Quintero, which have long been overpolluted, experienced serious episodes of environmental pollution, affecting the health of many citizens. In view of the seriousness of the situation, I immediately visited the areas concerned to meet with the authorities and the communities and to see and experience, with my own eyes and senses, the dramatic effects of that environmental disaster. During my visit, I made a promise to Chilean citizens to rewrite the future for those two communities and many others. To that end, we are  implementing  a plan to resolve the emergency situation and protect  our citizens’ health. We are also developing a long- term solution to enable us to better protect the quality\\n \\nand health of our water, air and soil through ongoing monitoring with the highest available technological standards and the implementation of extraordinary emission standards for polluting companies, as  well  as a comprehensive pollution plan that will enable us to permanently resolve such situations and achieve a definitive solution, putting an end to the so-called sacrificial zones in our country.\\nWe know that nature is not a gift inherited from our parents, and that we therefore cannot use it as we like. Rather, it is a loan from our children, grandchildren and future generations. We must nurture it and return it to them in better condition. That challenge must involve all stakeholders in society. Channelling collective and multisectoral efforts requires the commitment of us all. That is the aim of the framework law on climate change that we are implementing in Chile and that by 2030 will enable us to reduce our greenhouse-gas emissions by 30 per cent compared to the base year.\\nTo do it, we must incorporate the climate-change perspective into all public policy and private-sector commitments. We are doing just that by incorporating environmental and climate-change policies into our national investment system and our evaluation systems for public  expenditure  and  environmental  impact. In addition, we are including those concerns and commitments in both bilateral and multilateral trade agreements, such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, which unites 11 countries on both shores of the vast Pacific Ocean, as well as in the ways in which we are addressing the process of adding new members to the Pacific Alliance.\\nWithout doubt, those developments have reduced our carbon emissions and will continue to significantly reduce them while strengthening our economy. The challenge is extremely demanding and requires great determination and ambition. In that regard, we have two important allies, the first of which is technology. Today, the scientific imagination and innovation and the scientific and technological advances that have emerged from the freedom and creativity  of  free men and women have equipped us with new tools to combat this relatively new and serious threat..We must therefore continue to boost and foster our technology and scientific entrepreneurs so that they will join this fight and not repeat the errors of the past. In recent days we learned of an initiative that can clean the rubbish and plastic out of our oceans more efficiently. In our efforts\\nto fulfil our commitments, those are the technologies that we are using in my country.\\nMoreover, we have a multilateral system that enables us to act in a coordinated manner. That is precisely the point of the Sustainable Development Goals. However, we are aware that bureaucracy often slows down United Nations efforts. We must therefore improve coordination and be able to generate more delivery and accountability, while also focusing more on the results and less on the process. As a great United States President once remarked, our generation is in a unique twofold situation. We are the first generation  to feel the impact of climate change and also the last generation that can do something about it.\\nI shall now turn to human rights — the third challenge raised by the late  Kofi  Annan  20  years ago in this Hall — and the challenge of freedom, democracy and the rule of law. Five years ago, from this very rostrum (see A/68/PV.5), I was able to share the lessons and teachings of Chileans 40 years after the collapse of democracy in our country, and after its subsequent recovery. The lessons we have learned have specific relevance.\\nThe first and most important lesson is that there are always moral and legal norms that should be respected by everyone: combatants and non-combatants, civilians and soldiers, leaders and subordinates, with the result that atrocity crimes such as torture, crimes against humanity, terrorism, political assassination and forced disappearances can never be justified in any context, time, place or circumstance. Freedom, democracy, peace and civic friendship are much more fragile than we tend to think, which means that we must never take them for granted. They must always be valued, taught, fostered and protected, because they are like air. When we have it, we take it for granted, but when we do not, it is often too late to get it back.\\nIn Chile we are now a few days away from marking\\n30 years since the referendum of  5  October  1988  that paved the way for us to regain our freedom and democracy. I would like to take this opportunity to recall the two major transitions that our generation has had to face in Chile. The first of them enabled us to regain our freedom and democracy, which we achieved in an intelligent and exemplary manner. Normally such transitions take place amid political crisis, economic chaos and social violence, none of  which happened in\\n \\nour country. We were able to restore our freedom and democracy in an admirable manner.\\nHowever, that transition is now history. The new transition, our transition, that is currently under way and depends on us consists in transforming Chile, once the poorest of Spain’s Latin American colonies, into a developed country, without poverty and with greater social justice and equal opportunities, in which we can all develop our talents and life plans and live fuller and happier lives, by the end of the next decade. We must complete that transition with the same unity, generosity and intelligence with which we carried out the transition that allowed us to regain our democracy.\\nOn human rights, I want to clearly and strongly state today that human rights, freedom and democracy know no borders. I would  therefore like to bring to the General Assembly the voice of the Venezuelan people, which President Maduro’s regime has silenced. Venezuela is a sister nation that for many long decades was a democracy that brought great progress and well- being to its people, generously opening its borders to many Latin Americans so that they could find shelter, work and opportunity there that were not available in their own countries.\\nUnfortunately, today  Venezuela  is  governed  by a regime that respects none of its principles, neither freedom nor democracy nor human rights. It is a society that is being torn apart by a moral, political, social and humanitarian crisis — a  moral  crisis,  because the basic values of human rights are not respected; a political crisis, because there is no democracy, rule of law, separation of powers or freedom of expression, and there are hundreds of political prisoners; and an economic crisis, because Venezuela, once the richest country in Latin America, now has less than half the production capacity it had in its heyday.\\nIndeed, Venezuela is undergoing a tragedy. Its inhabitants are fleeing from a dismal and perilous existence. Many, too many, are literally losing their lives for lack of food and medicine. President Maduro, while denying the situation, is not letting in the humanitarian aid that many countries are willing to deliver. In recent years, more  than  2  million  Venezuelans  have  had to leave their country as a result of the crisis I have  just outlined. I ask myself how a President can be so ambitious and callous that he is willing to cause his own people such pain and suffering in order to prevail and cling to power.\\nHowever, Venezuela is not the only country in that situation. The same is  happening in countries such  as Nicaragua, in which more than 400 people have already died as a result of the violence fostered by the State and President Ortega’s Government. In fact, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which has reported assassinations, extrajudicial executions, ill-treatment, torture and arbitrary detentions in that country, was expelled from Nicaragua a month ago. There are also  similar occurrences in Cuba, where for more than 60 years there has been no freedom, democracy or basic respect for human rights, as evidenced by its arbitrary detentions and, as in Venezuela and Nicaragua, its censorship of freedom of expression, which is guaranteed under article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\\nChile does not recognize the legitimacy of the recent presidential elections in Venezuela, because they did not fulfil the basic requirements necessary for free, democratic and transparent elections, in accordance with international standards. We will therefore not recognize the legitimacy of the new Government that emerged from the election. Chile will continue to do all it can, in accordance with international law, to help the Venezuelan people to regain their freedom, democracy and human rights and emerge from the sad and tragic disaster affecting the country.\\nFor that to happen, we need the support of the multilateral system, in particular the United Nations. We believe that the Organization, through  the Security Council, should address the democratic and humanitarian crises affecting those countries. As I have said before, in modern times, freedom, democracy and respect for human rights do not and should not recognize borders. Chile will therefore use all the mechanisms available under international law and work with all its strength and commitment to restore freedom, democracy and human rights in those countries.\\nI would like to end my statement with a reflection on the current state of the United Nations and the reforms and updates that many countries think the United Nations now urgently requires. The United Nations, which has contributed to the maintenance of international peace and security on countless occasions as the cornerstone of multilateralism, today has highly restricted and limited powers. We have lost the ability to prevent crises and to strengthen the institutions of Member States with the aim of generating a true culture of democratic resilience that is capable of surviving\\n \\nbreakdowns, like those suffered in some countries in our region. We therefore believe that the time has come for the United Nations to modernize, as has been suggested by many Member States on various occasions, in order to be able to act more quickly and effectively in the face of the challenges of the modern age.\\nThe structure of the United Nations, and especially its Security Council, is a legacy of the victors in the Second World War, which ended more than 70 years ago, and it does not meet the needs and challenges of current times. In fact, we all know that some permanent members of the Security Council exercise or threaten to use their right to veto for reasons that are based more on their own interests or those of their allies than on their duty to preserve peace and security in every corner of our planet.\\nThat behaviour has reduced and continues to reduce the effectiveness of a fundamental organ of the United Nations that not only holds enormous power but also has a tremendous responsibility, that of preserving peace and security on our planet. In addition, the current composition of the Security Council does not reflect today’s world and does not adequately represent entire continents, such as Africa or Latin America, or countries such as Germany, India and Japan.\\nI would therefore like to conclude by emphasizing that it is not only development that should be sustainable, but also peace. It is precisely at times like these that the values we share as an international community should guide and illuminate our actions and the path ahead. People must not be united by free trade alone. What should guide us is the maintenance of peace and security and respect for the basic values that led to the formation of the Organization, and it is therefore those same values that must illuminate and guide the path to its future.\\nOnly by strongly and coherently reviving those values will the United Nations be able to fulfil its responsibilities and rise to the challenges of the new world we live in. Together with the formidable threats that we are confronted with, such as terrorism, global warming and mass migration, we also have magnificent opportunities that are generated by the freedom, imagination and unlimited creativity of the free men and women of this world.\\n',\n",
       " 'Ten days ago I was in Ukraine, picking up syringes and empty bottles in a park next to a kindergarten in the industrial city of Dnipro. It was on the occasion of the first World Cleanup Day, the biggest-ever civil-society action facilitated by digital technologies and the will of millions to volunteer. Fifteen million people in 140 countries, among whom were many Presidents and Prime Ministers, took part and decided to do something for our planet. They were responding to the outcry of Estonians who launched the voluntary clean-up action 10 years ago. It is very easy just to talk about a cleaner environment or climate change, but if you really want to get things done, then very often you simply must get up and do it yourself.\\nIn many ways, that is also the reason why Estonia is running for a non-permanent seat at the Security Council for the period 2020-2021, as small countries have no time for small objectives. Our aim, among others, is to bring all things digital to the Security Council. Cyberrisks are something that Estonians, as citizens of a fully digitized State, understand better than most. We want to offer our perspective so as to ensure that human beings remain safe in this new world where cyberrelated threats are combined with conventional ones. The vision that we have for our candidacy and\\n \\nfor the United Nations as a whole is based on three keywords: empathy, equality and efficiency.\\nFirst, with  regard  to  empathy,  however  sad they are, we must talk about our concerns honestly. Aggression should be called aggression, war is war and occupation remains occupation. Whether we are talking about Africa or Europe, I am always deeply touched by the misery that war and conflict cause, as I am when talking with internally displaced women and children in occupied eastern Ukraine or with Georgian politicians who are told that, because of the occupation, their country will forever be denied full participation in world democratic forums that we, who are luckier than they, preciously cherish. Estonia stands in solidarity with all those affected by conflict, terrorism and violent extremism. We reach out with humanitarian aid and practical assistance, as well as our peacekeepers, from Africa to the Middle East. We do what we can, yet it feels as though it is never enough.\\nOngoing military aggression in eastern Ukraine continues in the very heart of Europe. The Crimean peninsula remains occupied, as do parts of Georgia, and there is no resolution to the long-term and violent conflicts in Africa. It is hard to tolerate those tragic situations. Yet mincing words to make ourselves feel better is no solution. For those in distress, recognition of their true situation, together with the humble recognition that we cannot do much more than commiserate, is offering at least some hope —  some hope that one  day things could be better; a hope that cannot feed on euphemisms avoiding straightforward admittance.\\nIn July, we all reached an agreement on the global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration, and I am really looking forward to its adoption in Marrakech in December. But an agreement needs implementation. Without implementation, it is hollow — as hollow as the days ahead for those not knowing where they should lay their head for the night or how to calm their crying, hungry and frightened children. We need to get up and just go help.\\nThe same applies to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. In order to tackle the global challenge of climate change that is affecting billions, we must implement the commitments we have collectively undertaken, because the effects of climate change are increasingly being felt all over the world, not only in the developing countries — especially by small island States, where homes, food and even clean drinking\\nwater are greatly at risk and countries are forced to jump through varied and expensive hoops in order to gain access to relief funding — but also in the developed world, where people have lost their loved ones or homes in European forest fires or in hurricanes in America and the Pacific.\\nYet we are still not dealing with root causes, making the world safe for our children by applying the proper and best available technology standards to all energy production and use, both in the developed and in the developing world. We should also, very simply, never forget to switch the light off when leaving the room or get an air conditioner that stops automatically when we open the door — do what we can when we see that we cannot do it yet at the global level.\\nWe are all equals in this Hall, not only because we have declared so in the Charter of the United Nations, but also because the challenges we now face are going to affect each and every one of us. Equality in the face of global challenges is just the law of nature, which is much stronger than our international law could ever be. Yet, international legal space matters, as common solutions demand respect of each and every one.\\nWe see solutions in liberal thinking, but progress is not possible through polarization, fragmentation or tribalism. Progress is the force born out of debate and seeking common solutions. Sovereign equality — the idea that all sovereign States are equal — is a fundamental tenet of international law and relations. The role  of  the United Nations is to provide that equality, as a guarantor of the rules-based global system. We depend on each other, whether we like it or not.\\nAnd very often it is not the State or international organizations that get things done, but the grass-roots activists and non-governmental organizations that have a vision and a sense of responsibility. A principled voluntary approach can shift mountains of inefficiency, bad governance, neglect and lack of ideas. It can guide and catalyse policymaking, but not replace it.\\nRecent women movements like HeForShe have come a long way in countering gender-based and sexual violence. Gender equality is at the  very heart of human rights. With that in mind, Estonia is working actively in the Commission on the Status of  Women.  I have gladly and humbly accepted Secretary-General Guterres’ invitation to co-chair the High-Level Steering Group for Every Woman Every Child for the next two years. During my tenure, I intend to raise awareness\\n \\nof the heroic efforts people are making globally, often working without any institutional support. I wish to demonstrate how many good ideas there are around the world — ideas that have already been found and tried, but only on a small, scale, and that help someone, somewhere, waiting to be discovered and up-scaled in order to help as many in the world as possible. I hope to provide recognition, but also the dissemination of best practices, which are often the same thing. That is how I can personally get something done.\\nIn terms of efficiency — and  that  is  my  third key word — nothing is more important than truly effective multilateralism. Due to its inclusiveness, the Organization holds great legitimacy and, due to its high standards, it is a moral force. International law should be the primary yardstick of national interest. Those not so powerful, small States, understand that well.\\nOn Security Council reform, we need to win more space for common ground. Peoples and States, both big and small, should feel that the Security Council acts in their best interests. Too often, the Council falls victim to its internal differences and clumsy procedures. However, it should not be rendered powerless, especially when mass atrocities are being committed.\\nWe, together with the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency (ACT) group, have called for Security Council members to feel the responsibility and be held more accountable if they block action against breaches of international humanitarian law. It is telling that 117 States have already signed the ACT group’s code of conduct. Furthermore, we unwaveringly support the proposal of President Emmanuel Macron of France, together with Mexico, the Netherlands and other States, that in the face of great human suffering, the permanent members should voluntarily refrain from the use of their veto.\\nFurthermore, with respect to efficiency, information and communications technology can revolutionize entrepreneurship, education, employment in general, and even health care. Digital online services provide economic growth, bring down unnecessary barriers between citizen and State, as well as between businesses and sectors, and transcend geographical limits. Estonia has shared its knowledge with many nations of the world and will continue to do so, in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme, the African Union and all those interested and willing.\\nNew technologies should always be seen as enablers. They create equal opportunities if supported by proper policies. The risks related to them should not be ignored, also because they do not replace but rather enhance most of our conventional risks. But well-set international legal space should be able to deliver for humankind and avoid Armageddon scenarios.\\nNo new technology can thrive in a fragmented world. Now more than ever, we need global free trade as an essential element of fostering long-term development and growth. Estonia, as a small, export-dependent country, is an advocate of free trade, including through creating better market access for developing countries and improving business conditions for investments. Trade and economy are closely linked with security, as history has so often demonstrated.\\nWe stand to protect what the developed world has achieved, what the World Trade Organization stands for, and what aspiring regions and bodies have set out to achieve — for example, freedom of trade and work in Africa through legal space-setting by the African Union. We wish them speedy success, and we stand by them to help where we can with our own leapfrogging experience in digital technologies.\\nEmpathy starts at home. If we want to care about others, we need to care about ourselves and about the people and environment around us. Being connected and dependent on each other more than ever, we simply cannot afford to be self-centred and ignorant. We all need to see the bigger  picture. Empathy can easily    be translated into efficiency if we really wish to get things done. Words are important, but they are not sufficient if they are not followed by concrete action.\\nWars and conflicts continue, global warming is speeding up and the piles of litter around us just keep growing. We all have equal responsibility to be more proactive in preventing and  meeting  the  challenges of our times. When we are feeling helpless, it is sometimes best to do the little thing we know we are able to do. Globally, if we all do our bit, things can only get better. Our globe cannot take any more free-riding; any more hand-wringing and saying “we cannot”; any more inaction; any more hiding behind our current comforts — so let us just get up and go get things done.\\n',\n",
       " 'When I spoke here three years ago (see A/70/PV.22), Israel stood alone among the nations. Of the nearly 200 countries that sit in this Hall, only Israel openly opposed the nuclear deal with Iran. We opposed it because it threatens our future, even our very survival. We opposed it because the deal paved Iran’s path to a nuclear arsenal. By lifting the sanctions, it has fuelled Iran’s campaign of carnage and conquest throughout the Middle East. We opposed it because the deal was based on a fundamental lie, that Iran is not seeking to develop nuclear weapons.\\nIsrael exposed that lie earlier this year. In February 2018, Israel conducted a daring raid on Iran’s secret atomic archive. We obtained more than 100,000 documents and videos that had been stashed in vaults in an innocent-looking building in the heart of Tehran. In May, I presented a short summary of what we obtained to the international media. I provided hard evidence of Iran’s plans to build nuclear weapons and its plans to deceive the international community. Israel shared that information and even more damning evidence that we found with members of the five plus one group and with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\\nMonths have passed, and the IAEA has still not taken any action. It has not posed a single question to Iran. It has not demanded to inspect a single new site discovered in that secret archive. Given that inaction,  I have decided, therefore, to reveal today something else that we have shared with the IAEA and with a few intelligence agencies. What I am about to say has not been shared publicly before. Today I am disclosing for the first time that Iran has another secret facility in Tehran, a secret atomic warehouse for storing massive amounts of equipment and materiel from Iran’s secret nuclear-weapon programme.\\nIn May, we exposed the site of Iran’s secret atomic archive. It is in the Shorabad district of Tehran. Today I am revealing the site of a second facility, Iran’s secret atomic warehouse, which is located in the Torquzabad district of Tehran, just three miles away from the archive. Let me show exactly what the secret atomic warehouse looks like. From this image, it looks just like the atomic archive, another innocent-looking compound. For listeners at home using Google Earth, this no-longer-secret atomic warehouse is on Mehr Alley. The coordinates are on the image. Anyone can try to get there. And for those who try to get there, it  is a hundred meters from the Kalishoi, a rug-cleaning operation. By the way, I hear they do a fantastic job of cleaning rugs there. But by now they may be radioactive rags. That is the second secret site.\\nNow countries with satellite capabilities may notice some increased activity on Mehr Alley in the days and weeks ahead. The people they will see scurrying back and forth are Iranian officials desperately trying to finish the job of cleaning up that site. Since we raided the atomic archive, they have been busy cleaning out the atomic warehouse. Just last month, they removed 15 kilogrammes of radioactive materiel. What did they do with it? They had to get those 15 kilogrammes of radioactive materiel out of the site, so they took it out and spread it around Tehran in an effort to hide the evidence. The residents of Tehran, now endangered, may want to know that they can get a Geiger counter on Amazon for only $29.99. At today’s exchange rate, that is just 4 million Iranian rials. But we will get to that later. I will talk about the Iranian economy in a minute.\\nThey took that radioactive material and spread it around Tehran. The Iranian officials cleaning out the site still have a lot of work to do, because they had at least 15 gigantic ship containers full of nuclear-related equipment  and  materiel  stored  there.  Since  each of\\n \\nthose containers can hold 20 tons of materiel, the site must have contained as much as 300 tons of nuclear- related equipment and materiel, all in that very place.\\nWe now have to ask ourselves a question. Why did Iran keep a secret atomic archive and a secret atomic warehouse? After all, when South Africa and Libya gave up their nuclear programmes, the first thing they did was to destroy both the archives and the materiel and equipment. The answer to the question is simple. The reason Iran did not destroy its atomic archive and its atomic warehouse is because it has not abandoned its goal to develop nuclear weapons. In fact, it planned to use both of those sites in a few years when the time was right to break out the atom bomb. Delegations may rest assured that that will not happen. It will not happen because what Iran hides Israel will find.\\nI have a message for  the  Head  of  the  IAEA,  Mr. Yukiya Amano. I believe he is a good man. I believe he wants to do the right thing. I therefore ask him to do the right thing now. The IAEA should inspect that atomic warehouse immediately, before the Iranians finish clearing it out. Do delegations remember the time when we were promised that inspections could take place anytime, anywhere? Well, how about inspections of Mehr Alley right now? And while Mr. Amano is at it, he should inspect the other sites that we told him about. Once and for all, he should tell the world the truth about Iran.\\nI also have a message today for the tyrants of Tehran. Israel knows what they are doing, and Israel knows where they are doing it. Israel will never let a regime that calls for our destruction develop nuclear weapons — not now, not in 10 years, not ever. And Israel will do whatever it must do to defend itself against Iran’s aggression. We will continue to act against it in Syria. We will act against it in Lebanon. We will act against it in Iraq. We will act against it whenever and wherever we must. We must act to defend our State and to defend our people.\\nThree years ago, a few weeks after the nuclear deal was completed, I asked this question from this very podium: does anyone seriously believe that flooding Iran’s radical theocracy with weapons and cash will curb its appetite for aggression? But many of the deal’s supporters believed just that. They believed that Iran’s regime would become more moderate, more peaceful. They believed that Iran would use the billions of dollars it received in sanctions relief to improve the lives of\\nits people — solving the water problem, the trucking problem, the electricity problem and improving hospitals and schools. That is what they believed. Perhaps some people here today also believed that.\\nWell, it did not happen. Instead, Iran used the money to fuel its vast war machine. Just this past year, Iran has attacked Kurds in Iraq, slaughtered Sunnis in Syria, armed Hizbullah in Lebanon, financed Hamas in Gaza, fired missiles into Saudi Arabia and threatened the freedom of navigation in the Strait  of  Hormuz and the Strait of Bab El-Mandeb. That is some peace, some moderation.\\nIf people think that Iran’s aggression has been confined to the Middle East, they need to  think again. Last month, two Iranian agents were arrested for plotting terror attacks here in the United States, and several weeks ago, Iranian agents were arrested for plotting terror attacks in the heart of Europe. Yet while the United States is confronting Iran with new sanctions, Europe and others are appeasing Iran by trying to help it bypass those new sanctions.\\nNow, I have just used a tough word,  a  very  strong word: appeasement. I use it reluctantly. But unfortunately that is exactly what we are seeing again in Europe. We need to think about that. The same week that Iran was caught red-handed trying to murder European citizens, European leaders were rolling out the red carpet for President Rouhani, promising to give Iran even more money. As the son of a historian, I have to ask — and I ask it not merely as a historian’s son, but as a Jew, a citizen of the world and someone who has lived through the twentieth century — have these European leaders learned nothing from history? Will they ever wake up?\\nWe in Israel do not need a wake-up call, because Iran threatens us every day. Despite the  best  of  hopes — and there were many hopes around the nuclear deal — that deal did not push war further away. It brought it ever closer to our borders. In Syria, Iran  is trying to establish permanent military bases against us and has already launched missiles and drones into our territory. In Gaza, Iran is arming terror groups to launch rocket attacks on our cities and terror attacks on our civilians. In Lebanon, Iran is directing Hizbullah in the building of secret sites for converting inaccurate projectiles into precision-guided missiles that can hit targets deep inside Israel with an accuracy of within 10 metres.\\n \\nThe Assembly needs to listen to this. Hizbullah is deliberately using the innocent people of Beirut as human shields. It has placed three of these missile-conversion sites alongside Beirut’s international airport. I can show a picture that is worth a thousand missiles. In it, we can see Beirut’s international airport, the first missile site, which is in the Ouzai neighbourhood, on the water’s edge, a few blocks away from the runway. There is also a second site, which is underneath a soccer stadium, two blocks away, and a third site, which is adjacent to the airport itself, right next to it.\\nI therefore have a message for Hizbullah today. Israel also knows what it is doing. Israel knows where it is doing it. And Israel will not let it get away with it. Just as supporters of the nuclear deal were wrong about what would happen when sanctions were removed, they were dead wrong about what would happen when sanctions were restored. They argued that United States sanctions alone would have little economic impact on Iran. That is what they said. It is hard to believe.\\nLet us take a look at what  has  happened  to  Iran’s economy now that President Trump has forced companies to choose between doing business with Iran and doing business with the United States, whose gross domestic product is 50 times the size of Iran’s gross domestic product. A year ago, Iran’s economy was booming. Now it is collapsing. Iran’s currency is plummeting. Inflation and unemployment are soaring. British airlines, German banks, French oil companies, Japanese oil importers and many others are scrambling to get out. If that is little economic impact, we can imagine what will happen with the next batch of United States sanctions, which will be imposed in November.\\nThe deal’s supporters were also wrong when they argued — and it is hard to believe that they argued this, despite the fact that I have had many arguments with them — that restoring sanctions would rally the Iranian people around the regime. While they are definitely rallying, their rallying is definitely not around the regime. They are rallying against the regime. They are not chanting “Death to America”. They are chanting “Death to the dictator”. They are not chanting “Export the Islamic Revolution”. They are chanting “Leave Syria”, “Leave Lebanon”, “Leave Gaza”, and “Take care of us in Iran”.\\nI listen to those protests. I talk to Iranian people. I show videos and get so many responses — from Iranians. At first, I thought they were Iranian exiles — in the\\nsafety of London or Paris or Los Angeles. No, these are Iranians from Iran, embracing Israel, criticizing their regime — that is an understatement — with their names. Shortly after the protests broke out, I asked my intelligence people, “What is going on?”\\nThose protests are an indicator of something extraordinary that has been taking  place there. Through those protests, the Iranian people are showing unbelievable courage. The protests are now embracing the whole of Iran — from the urban centres to distant villages, from the striking merchants in the bazaars to the young women  uncovering their hair.  The people of Iran are bravely standing up to a regime that has brutally repressed them for four decades and that has squandered — and still squanders — their money in bloody wars across the Middle East.\\nThis is what I say to Europe’s leaders and to others. Instead of coddling Iran’s dictators, join the United States and Israel and most of  the Arab world  in supporting new sanctions against a regime that endangers all of us across the world.\\nIsrael is deeply grateful to President Trump for his bold decision to withdraw from the disastrous nuclear deal with Iran. A great many of our Arab neighbours are also grateful. And everyone who cares about the peace and security of the world should also be grateful.\\nBut I have an important confession to make. It  may be surprising, but I have to admit that the Iran deal has had one positive consequence, an unintended but positive consequence. By empowering Iran, it has brought Israel and many Arab States closer than they have ever been before, in an intimacy and friendship that I have not seen in my lifetime and that would have been unimaginable a few years ago.\\nWhen friendships are formed around a threat or a challenge, opportunities are quickly seen, not just for security but for how to bring a better life to our peoples, which is what Israel can and wants to contribute to. Israel deeply values those new friendships, and I hope the day will soon arrive when Israel will be able to expand peace, a formal peace, beyond Egypt and Jordan to other Arab neighbours, including the Palestinians. I look forward to working with President Trump and his peace team to achieve that goal.\\nI also want to take the opportunity now, here at the United Nations, a place I know something about because many years ago I served here as Ambassador\\n \\nfor many years, to express Israel’s appreciation to President Trump and Ambassador Haley for the unwavering support they have provided to Israel at  the United Nations. They have unequivocally backed Israel’s right to defend itself.  They rightly pulled out of a history-denying UNESCO and a morally bankrupt Human Rights Council. I think that more resolutions about Israel than about the rest of the world combined have been introduced in those bodies, and tenfold the number of resolutions on Iran, Syria or any other State. It is not even fair to say “tenfold”, because there are no multiples of zero.\\nPresident Trump and Ambassador Haley also stopped funding an unreformed United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, an organization that perpetuates the Palestinian refugee problem instead of solving it. Day after day, the Trump Administration has stood up to what has long been a specialty here at the United Nations, slandering Israel. Even though the shameful resolution 3379\\n(XXX) comparing Zionism to racism was repealed 25 years ago, I am sorry to say that its foul stench still clings to these halls.\\nIsrael airlifted Ethiopian Jews to freedom and a new life in Israel, in the Jewish State. Yet here at the United Nations Israel is absurdly accused of racism. Israel’s Arab citizens vote in our elections, serve in our Parliament, preside over our courts and have exactly the same individual rights as all other Israeli citizens. Yet here at the United Nations Israel is shamefully accused of apartheid. Today there are at least five times as many Palestinians as there were in 1948, the year of Israel’s founding. Yet here at the United Nations Israel is outrageously accused of ethnic cleansing. Do those here know what that is? It is the same old anti-Semitism with a brand-new face. That is all it is.\\nOnce it was the Jewish people who were slandered and held to a different standard; today it is the Jewish State that is slandered and held to a different standard. Here is an example. Take the outlandish attacks that have been levelled against Israel after our Knesset, our Parliament, recently adopted a law declaring Israel the nation-State of the Jewish people. Nevertheless, Israel is a free country. People can oppose that law, and people have done so. People can call for different wording in this or that clause, or add or delete a clause. People can do that.\\nBut when Israel is called racist for making  Hebrew its official language and the Star of  David  its national flag, when Israel is labelled an apartheid State for declaring itself the nation-State of the Jewish people — that is downright preposterous. And does the Assembly know why? Because represented in the Hall today are more than 100 countries that have only one official language, even though many other languages are commonly spoken within those countries. There are more than 50 countries here that have crosses or crescents on their flags, even though they have many non-Muslims and non-Christians living in  their  midst. And there are dozens of countries that define themselves as nation-States of a particular people, even though there are many ethnic and national minorities within their borders. None of those countries have been denigrated or libelled for celebrating their unique national identity. Only Israel is denigrated. Only Israel is libelled. What is unique about the Jewish people is not that we have a nation-State. What is unique is that many still oppose our having a nation-State.\\nMoments ago, President Abbas outrageously said that Israel’s nation-State law proves that Israel is a racist, apartheid State. President Abbas should know better. He wrote a dissertation denying the Holocaust. His Palestinian National Authority imposes death sentences on Palestinians for selling land to Jews. Let me repeat that. If a Jew buys an apartment or a piece of land anywhere in the Palestinian territories, the Palestinian who sold  him that land is executed. That  is what the law says. President Abbas proudly pays Palestinian terrorists who murder Jews. In fact, the more they slay, the more he pays. That is in their law too. Then how can he condemn Israel’s morality and call Israel racist?\\nThat is not the way to peace. That is not the way  to achieve the peace that we all want and need and to which Israel remains committed. This body should not be applauding the Head of a regime that pays terrorists. The United Nations should condemn such a despicable policy. And the United Nations, which brokered an Israeli-Palestinian ceasefire in 2014, should demand that Hamas release our fallen soldiers Oron Shaul and Hadar Goldin. The latter was kidnapped when Hamas violated that very ceasefire. Hamas should also release the two Israeli citizens whom it holds captive, Avera Mengistu and Hisham Al-Sayed.\\nEvery time I stand here I  feel  as  I  do  today.  I am privileged to stand here as the Prime Minister\\n \\nof the State of Israel, a Jewish and democratic State. Some believe that Israel cannot be both Jewish and democratic. That is false. Israel is both, and Israel will always remain both. Ever since Abraham and Sarah made their journey to the promised land, nearly 4,000 years ago, the land of  Israel has been our homeland. It is the place where Isaac and Rebecca, Jacob, Leah and Rachel carried out their eternal covenant with God. It is where Joshua made us a sovereign nation, where David ruled and Isaiah preached, where the Maccabees fought and where Masada fell. It is the place from which we were exiled and to which we returned, rebuilding our ancient and eternal capital, Jerusalem. The nation-State of Israel is the only place where the Jewish people proudly exercise our collective right of self-determination. That right was recognized nearly a century ago by the League of Nations, and more than 70 years ago by the United Nations when it supported the establishment of a Jewish State. That is what resolution 181 (II) said, “a Jewish State”.\\nAt the same time, Israel is a vibrant democracy, where all its citizens, Jews and non-Jews alike, enjoy equal individual rights, and those rights are guaranteed by law. In Israel, whether a person is a Jew or an  Arab, a Christian or a Muslim, a Druze or a Bedouin or anything else, that person’s individual rights are exactly the same and will always  remain the same.  In the Middle East that is not obvious. Now that is an understatement. In the Middle East, where women are often treated as property, minorities are persecuted and gays are hanged, Israel stands out as a shining example of freedom and progress.\\nI could not be more proud to represent my country, Israel. I am proud that we have made Israel a global technological Power of breathtaking creativity in information technology and precision agriculture. Is the Assembly aware that we target the fertilizer and the water down to the individual plant — not to a field,  not to part of a field, but down to the plant? I am proud of those geniuses that have brought those unbelievable developments in water management, cybersecurity, autonomous vehicles, digital health, medical devices and so many other fields that are improving the lives of billions of people around the world. I am proud of Israel’s brilliant scholars, innovative entrepreneurs, talented artists, devoted teachers and compassionate doctors, and of our search-and-rescue teams who save lives from Haiti to Mexico, from Nepal to the Philippines. I am also proud of Israel’s courageous soldiers, the men\\nand women who bravely defend our homeland while upholding the highest values. Most of all, I am proud of the people of Israel, who draw extraordinary strength from the deep wellsprings of our heritage, who possess an unbreakable spirit and who are as determined as ever to build a secure and magnificent future for the one and only Jewish State.',\n",
       " 'It takes decades to build peace and trust, but it only takes seconds, one selfish or narrow-minded decision, to break them. We gather here every year to enhance what we have been building for over 70 years: an idea of a world based on  rules and the principles of humanity, responsibility, tolerance and peaceful coexistence, where wars and armed conflicts have no place, where disputes are solved in dialogue and where challenges are addressed through cooperation.\\nWe are continuously becoming wealthier and more advanced. With all the resources we can generate together, we might have the means  necessary  to reach even the poorest of the poor. Yet we are more often driven by selfishness and short-term interests. Instead of enlarging freedom, cooperation and healthy competition, we introduce restrictions  and  trade wars. While globalization has created unprecedented wealth, inequalities still divide our planet. Economic figures are positive but, in many parts of our world, have hardly translated into improved well-being and dignity for every human being. At an amazing pace, we continue to develop technologies allowing us to connect, communicate and be closer globally. But the distance between people and the gap in understanding and empathy towards other cultures remains huge. Yet, thanks to innovation, the world has never been smaller. What happens thousands of kilometres away can turn into a global problem in a matter of minutes, and global problems have a direct impacts on our citizens. Against that backdrop, the United Nations plays an irreplaceable role. It has enormous potential to overcome those paradoxes. Its strong principles, responsible action and ability to drive cooperation are what make it so unique. Let me touch upon those aspects in more detail.\\nRules and principles and their enforcement must remain the backbone of the Organization because today\\n \\nit seems that playing by the rules has become old- fashioned, as if ignoring them were a sign of strength and respect a sign of weakness.\\nThe number of armed conflicts has increased in recent years. In only 2016 and 2017, the number of conflicts equalled the peak of the Cold War era. The number of civilian casualties rise. We are talking about hundreds of thousands of innocent people directly affected by conflicts and war.\\nSovereignty and territorial integrity are the DNA of global and regional stability and security. But the occupation of Georgia and Ukraine and destabilization in the region are just one of many examples of respect for rules being replaced by ruthless power politics.\\nThe threat of nuclear weapons resonates much more often than we could have imagined in the recent years. We hope that the developments under way in North Korea will bring about tangible results. We must make sure that agreements will be kept. And if not, we need to act with resolve.\\nToo often we see thousands of civilians massacred by their very regimes, or in endless conflicts, as if we had become unmoved by the breaching of the very norms of humanity and stopped counting the innocent lives lost in Syria, Yemen, Palestine, Myanmar, South Sudan and elsewhere.\\nTogether we have agreed that the use of weapons of mass destruction is unacceptable, without exception. Any use of chemical weapons must be a red line and not tolerated — an automatic trigger for resolute action. It is therefore shameful to see the tyrannical regime in Syria repeatedly use chemical weapons against its own citizens for the sake of survival. As for us, Europeans, it is shocking to witness the attacks in Salisbury, Great Britain, with the perpetrators avoiding responsibility and shamelessly denying the facts.\\nIt is our responsibility to make sure that no perpetrator escapes unpunished. We must  firmly show that we will not allow our principles to be bent  to aggressive politics, that we will not undermine the authority of this Organization by inaction.\\nWe all have a great responsibility towards our citizens, the international community and the planet to lead, to stand firmly behind our values and to defend them. We must listen to our people not only to address their problems, but also to see far enough to inspire them, in particular vis-à-vis extremism, populism,\\nradicalism, xenophobia, racism, propaganda, lies, the twisting of the truth, and terrorism. Their goals are simple and yet effective: to spread fear, hatred and doubt, erode our beliefs and values and undermine our unity. They provide seemingly quick and simple solutions, provoking confrontation and drawing dividing lines.  It is no surprise they find fertile soil everywhere we fail to deliver. People living in poverty, afflicted by hunger or disease, with no access to education or health care are among their natural targets. And we will not win this fight if we do not offer those people and their children hope for a better life of dignity, free of fear of hunger or death. That is why our unity in implementing the development goals, in fighting climate change and addressing migration is so important. We need to turn our plans and our promises into a global reality. Failing to do so only sends a signal of our weakness, leaving those people and this planet as easy prey.\\nThe unprecedented progress and innovation of new technology brings with it new challenges. I am very concerned about malicious activities in cyberspace. Growing manipulation through social media is undermining democracy worldwide and indoctrinating our populations. Cyberspace knows no borders. It is anonymous and provides  unlimited  room  to  strike  at us. The choice of means is endless: to manipulate elections, to influence decisions, to spy on us or sneak into our computers, networks and  everyday lives.  It  is as dangerous as any conventional threat. As such   it requires our utmost attention. But, to date, we have done nothing or little about it. Global companies prefer their profits over their responsibilities. It is therefore up to us, States, to set new standards and, where needed, regulations — because today we do not lead, we only follow. And the price of inaction may soon be very high.\\nToo often, we hear political leaders issue calls to fight extremism and propaganda with the same tools and rhetoric. They could not be more wrong. The only honest answer is to support tolerance, freedom of speech and critical thinking in our societies. The only potent defence is to strengthen our values and to bring candid solutions to people’s problems. Only when we deliver may our democratic ideology become immune to extremist ideas and propaganda. In that effort, we need to remember that free media are our allies, not our enemies. They are guardians of our principles. They are often the first to spot when things go in\\n \\nthe wrong direction. They hold those who break the rules accountable.\\nWe should therefore be worried indeed about increased attacks on journalists, attempts to eliminate the freedom of the press, and growing restrictions on civil societies. Sadly, last year dozens of journalists were killed, hundreds imprisoned and thousands oppressed. The climate of hate continues to spread, portraying them as enemies of the State, enemies of nations or even of faiths. But they play a key role in  our mission for a better world, and as such they must be protected.\\nNone of our countries, even the most powerful, is big enough to face present challenges on its own, be they migration, terrorism, climate change or sustaining solid economic growth. While our most important duty as politicians is to serve our people, that will be possible only if we truly understand the value of cooperation and that, if we truly want to change the world for the better, we need to think of others — individuals, nations and countries — and patiently explain this principle to our people.\\nAs Kofi Annan said,\\n“More than ever before in human history, we share a common destiny. We can master it only if we face it together. And that, my friends, is why we have the United Nations”.\\nI admit that multilateralism is not always easy,  but  it is the only sustainable way. The United Nations will serve its purpose as long as we, the Member States, hold true to our commitments and stand ready to defend rules and principles. The noble ideals and strong principles of this Organization — the steadfast values of tolerance, empathy, compassion and solidarity — are our best tools for facing any challenge. If we protect those values, the  moral  compass  of  humankind, then the evil of aggressive power politics, selfish nationalism, extremism and racism will not prevail. We may not know what comes tomorrow, but we know how to respond if we let the moral compass guide us. The best assurance we can have in times of uncertainty is to protect our values.\\nI wish to conclude by congratulating the President of the General Assembly on assuming her duties. The challenges I spoke about are not easy to tackle, but I have full confidence that the United Nations and her Office will guide the Assembly through these times\\nwith the utmost dedication to fulfilling our common goals. I therefore also wish proudly to thank and congratulate her predecessor, Mr. Miroslav Lajčák, for the professionalism with which he served the United Nations and its peoples.']"

We congratulate the Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, for the moral and intellectual courage he has displayed in his work and for his interest in the new problems of the world.\\n129.\\tThe thirtieth anniversary of the United Nations invites us to think deeply, not only on the future of the Organization but also on the future of the world.\\n130.\\tThe most serious mistake that could be made would be to underrate everything the United Nations has done, during these 30 years, for peace in the world. No less serious a mistake would be to ask more from the United Nations than it actually can give. The Organization now has before it important problems in regard to restructuring itself. There is no doubt that over the past 30 years the emphasis and intensity of many subjects has changed. The legitimacy of the United Nations is now more complex and more demanding. As we come closer to new social and economic processes we shall have to become more dynamic and act more speedily. We are beginning live in an era of negotiations and compromises as well as of choices of alternatives. Understandings and compromises are possible but not always easy to achieve. In the next quarter of a century, the United Nations must contribute to outlining perspectives and discovering new horizons. The essential aim in the years to come will be to achieve a just world for all mankind.\\n131.\\tThe United Nations was not born to shape a Utopia but to strengthen a specific community of free nations and help to formulate, in political and universal terms, the broad outlines of human development.\\n132.\\tThe continuity of this great forum of nations and great world assembly for over a quarter of a century is proof of its moral vigour, its growing influence, and its genuine possibilities of existence and improvement.\\n133.\\tThis has been a period of ever more complex mutations and changes in historical development. From pre-cybernetic society, some countries are moving ever more rapidly towards a post-industrial society, and from a world characterized by purely continental relations we are entering a period of historic simultaneity. This era, deeply influenced by multi- continental relations, ties and bonds, confers a global meaning to all that we aspire to, undertake or plan.\\n134.\\tThe process of identification of the cold war has ended. Traditional models have been eroded. The time of automatic alignments is past.\\n135.\\tThe era of social changes we live in has incorporated into the world of political decisions countries which today belong to this Organization and which aspire to be protagonists and not merely witnesses of international political decisions.\\n136.\\tThe new countries thus constitute an emerging political power that is essential to the political and economic balance of the world. The developing countries now form a community of fundamental peoples no longer to be ignored or brushed aside. Their aspirations, their desire to participate in decisions and to affirm their destinies are not incompatible with the well-being of developed nations. On the contrary, the stability of the developing countries of the third world, the forcefulness of their identity and their dedication to stable goals of internal growth give them not only confidence in the international political and economic order, but contribute to the stability of the industrial countries. In the nineteenth century and until the Second World War, the balance of the world depended exclusively on understanding among the great Powers. At the present juncture in the life of man, the balance of the planet depends on all countries, whether they be poor or developed, large or small.\\n137.\\tThe developing countries have no reason to apply automatic thinking which might lead them to repeat mistakes or processes of the industrial society. An important task for the new nations will be to conceive and devise their own formulas which will in some ways be original. Regrettably, there is not as yet sufficient communication between the third world and the industrial nations. Our countries find difficulty in getting their opinions and views brought to inter-national public attention and, to a certain extent, there is lack of information on the social and economic problems caused by poverty.\\n138.\\tWe shall have to find a way out of these mechanisms of world-wide lack of information or counter- information which at times affect the prestige and the image to which the developing countries are entitled as far as world public opinion is concerned. There must be a review of the procedures and institutions of world public information so that in some way we can improve the balance of information and thus meet the information needs of all countries and not just of certain isolated countries or groups of countries. The present crisis is essentially the collapse of the standards and patterns of behaviour of the industrial society. There is no need for us to be heirs to those standards and patterns.\\n139.\\tThis inevitable political change constitutes a historic event which is called interdependence, which has recently been dramatically revealed by the energy crisis and inflation. Both phenomena are the consequences of an economic and social system and of an artificially constructed type of balance directed towards the preservation of the economic health of the industrial nations alone. It was an unjust arbitrary order and the source of permanent imbalances and disturbances, which went hand in hand with habits of waste, uncontrolled military expenditure and unforgivable ethical omissions and negligence.\\n140.\\tUnrestrained consumerism and placing value exclusively on material assets as the only references of human growth and the yardstick of universal progress are the most notorious aberrations of that world order.\\n141.\\tFor a long time the consequences were suffered only by the developing countries and by all the countries which now constitute the third world. More recently the effects of the system have been felt also by the industrial countries, which are now discovering a fundamental fact: the interdependence of nations. We, the countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America, have so far been the traditional victims of dependence. Most of us in Latin America have enjoyed political independence since the beginning of the nineteenth century, but we remained involved within implacable mechanisms of economic subordination, from which we now wish to be free. Even now that interdependence is given a conceptual value, the dependence of the weaker countries still subsists. For interdependence to mean what it really should mean, concrete agreements are necessary which will alter the assessments and perspectives of the past.\\n142.\\tThe United Nations and other international organizations allow us to evaluate the experiences gained from multilateral relations. Furthermore, bilateral relations are increasingly useful when they are frank, honest and to the point. But, in addition to this, it is necessary to point out the importance of concerted action whereby groups of nations agree on certain subjects. In that way, certain imbalances are being corrected and others can be rectified in the future.\\n143.\\tThe decision to raise the price of oil was not a mere whim of irresponsible or adventurous Governments with the intention of committing aggression against the industrial nations or disturbing the world's economic balance. It was a decision of sovereign countries which did not want to continue to permit the devaluation of their resources. It is impossible to think that the traditionally poor countries are prospering at the expense of the rich countries. That would be tantamount to saying that a plutocracy of the poor was coming into being.\\n144.\\tThe oil-producing countries are being accused of being the cause of the present economic imbalance, but the fact that the incidence of increased oil prices in the inflationary process is insignificant when compared to other inflationary prices which pre-dated the rise in the price of oil is overlooked.\\n145.\\tDuring the years when oil prices were kept artificially low, the inflationary process continued to intensify. Inflation had been in evidence in previous years, while it was in the last two years that the oil- producing countries decided to increase their prices.\\n146.\\tThe changes which have occurred during the past two years pose unprecedented international problems, especially for the developing countries. It is assumed that the current account deficit of these countries might rise from $10,000 million in 1973 to over $30,000 million in 1975. Less than one third of that deficit can be attributed to oil prices. The remaining two thirds is the result of increased prices of manufactured goods and of food and the deterioration in the prices of products exported by the developing countries.\\n147.\\tThe members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries [OPEC] are aware of their international responsibility. The Conference of Sovereigns and Heads of State of the Member Countries of OPEC, held at Algiers in March 1975, is proof of their maturity and of a highly developed sense of international co-operation. OPEC is not an aggressive group intent on taking decisions against the industrial nations; it is a serious, thoughtful organization which in no way wants to assume irresponsible attitudes. One of the absurdities of the present economic order is the dichotomy which has been created between producers and consumers. In the world today we are all producers and we are all consumers.\\n148.\\tToday every country, large or small, has an international responsibility. This is one of the most significant changes in the present political order of the world. The nation which I represent is fully conscious of this fact.\\n149.\\tThe President of Venezuela has proposed to other member nations of OPEC the setting up of a fund of between $1,500 million and $2,000 million for the non-imbursable financing of the increase in the price of oil resulting from the adjustment of prices, for the benefit of third-world countries which are not oil producers.\\n150.\\tThe basic problem of the current economic order is to provide stability for the development plans of the third-world countries, which have been hardest hit by inflation, deterioration in export prices and monetary upheavals. It is to be hoped that the forthcoming UNCTAD meeting will represent an important advance toward this objective, Poverty is an accusation against the entire present historical order.\\n151.\\tThe problem would be simplified if we quickly took concrete steps to create certain systems which, like the Agriculture Development Fund, established balances.\\n152.\\tIt would be, to say the least, arbitrary to imagine that responsibility lies exclusively with the oil-producing nations. That would mean absolving the great industrial nations from their international responsibilities and would also be contrary to the fundamental concept that in a world of increasing interdependence, responsibilities are also interdependent.\\n153.\\tFor Venezuela, the policy of defending natural resources is continuous and traditional, not only as a co-founder of OPEC, but also in carrying out important internal decisions. Recently, we have adopted two historic decisions: the nationalization of iron and the nationalization of oil.\\n154.\\tBoth decisions are the result of a national consensus which was arrived at within the pluralistic democratic society which is the essence of the Venezuelan political system. By enactment of pre-existing laws and regulations resulting from the free debate of public opinion and political parties, as well as from previously known programs, we have nationalized iron and oil. Therefore, this is not an international conspiracy against any country, nor against any specific interests; it is the affirmation of a free and sovereign people, conscious of the importance of its resources and conscious, too, of its will to administer them without any dependence or subordination.\\n155.\\tThis is part of an even broader policy to which the President of Venezuela is committed, namely that of developing ecological balance and all non-renewable natural resources. The Government of my country has fully identified itself with the goals of protecting the waters of rivers, lakes and oceans, the flora and the fauna from depredation and aggression. We are also aware that a policy of this type must be carried out on a world-wide level. That is why we believe in the increasingly important role which the United Nations can play in this respect over the coming 25 years.\\n156.\\tWe must defend the planet for all mankind and we must do so in universal democratic terms, so that the resources of nature may benefit the vast majorities and not be for the exclusive benefit of a few.\\n157.\\tAt this new session of the Assembly, we face the imperative necessity to remember that it is urgent to establish a climate of international trust. The Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, held recently at Helsinki, and other events, have given rise to optimism. In connexion with that Conference the attempt by industrial countries better to appreciate the development problems of the third world must not be overlooked. Understanding must be followed by action. We think that the future conference to be held in Paris will provide an opportunity for a useful dialog to define world international co-operation in specific terms. Most of what was said in the past serves no useful purpose today. We must find a new conceptual order to express the new political and economic system. dialog between industrialized countries and the developing countries is possible.\\n158.\\tThere exist alternatives for understanding and compromise. It will be necessary to strengthen the credibility of agreements and the good faith of arrangements. It is not possible to continue to deal with oversimplifications. We must place problems within a rational context.\\n159.\\tRaw materials, development, oil prices, the cost of manufactured goods and food are not part of separate constellations. They are all integrated into a vital process of reciprocal inter-connexions and clear ties.\\n160.\\tIn other words, in this Assembly new types of solidarity have been ushered in. My country had a concept of international solidarity from the time it emerged as an independent nation during the first quarter of the nineteenth century. Oil was unknown to us then; we were simply a small agricultural society on the northern shores of South America. But even at that early stage Simon Bolivar convened a Congress in Panama to define the strategy for continental unity. Long before we became an oil-producing nation, we were a Latin American nation. Now we are fully convinced that to be identified with Latin America alone is not enough; we must, on the contrary, think and act within a broader framework: that of solidarity with the countries of the third world,\\n161.\\tBeyond these alliances, Venezuela believes in its role as a participant in any and all initiatives aimed at fostering the mechanisms of world co-operation, which means simply that we are identified with the fate and future of mankind. In this effort, we recognize no difference between great or small, capitalist or socialist, industrialized or non-industrialized nations, whether north, south, east or west.\\n162.\\tAs an oil-producing country Venezuela has, with modesty but good will, defined several programs for international co-operation. With Central America, with nations of the Caribbean and other countries in the southern part of our continent, we have reached important agreements. Venezuela has pledged funds for international co-operation to a total of $2,724 million, which amounts to more than 8 per cent of our gross national product, thus largely exceeding the quota fixed by the United Nations for the developed countries. We realize, however, that isolated initiatives are not in themselves sufficient, and that is why, with other oil-producing and non-oil-producing nations, we are developing a broader plan to contribute to international development.\\n163.\\tIn accord with the resolution unanimously adopted during the seventh special session of the General Assembly, which constitutes a substantive change in international economic relations, we must all act with the necessary loyalty to ensure that those principles will dispel doubts and suspicions and effectively contribute to the creation of an atmosphere favorable to the holding of concrete negotiations. We have agreed that we must not return to the past and therefore any manifestations of dissent from the agreements adopted here may cast serious doubts on the sincerity of the consensus and the flexibility demonstrated so far.\\n164.\\tThe forthcoming Paris Conference will meet under the auspices of the agreements adopted here. In our opinion, it will be the first negotiation with a historical perspective between industrial countries and developing countries, whose points of view concerning a global approach to world economic problems were fortunately accepted. We attach paramount importance to that Conference. Interdependence in the future, the soundness and stability of the world economy and of the new international economic order will depend on the wisdom, lucidity and understanding of the negotiators, as well as on the political will which is demonstrated.\\n165.\\tOur active participation in the struggle against colonialism and racial discrimination is already well known and forms part of the history of these 30 years of our Organization.\\n166.\\tIn welcoming today three new Member States, the Republics of Mozambique, Cape Verde and Sao Tome and Principe, thus adding independent countries to the United Nations, we cannot but rejoice to see the inevitable end of the colonial era in the world.\\n167.\\tIt is with equal pleasure that we greet the independence of Suriname, a Latin American country which is a brotherly neighbor of Venezuela and which we hope will join us in the United Nations during this session.\\n168.\\tIt is not only at the economic level that we express solidarity, but also in terms of global and regional politics. We seek a peaceful and lasting settlement in the Middle East which will solve the problem of the Palestinian people. We look forward to an equitable solution in Cyprus, Rhodesia and Namibia, and we hope, with most of the peoples of the world, for the eradication of apartheid from South Africa. A similar sense of international solidarity leads us to hope for a prompt political solution in the Korean peninsula which may end for ever the unrest and disturbance in that area.\\n169.\\tIn Latin America, Bolivia and Panama have our complete solidarity. We hope that the problem of landlocked Bolivia, which was explained at this meeting by President Banzer of Bolivia, will be solved harmoniously by the countries concerned, and we are pleased at the progress which he announced. We also hope that the matter of the Panama Canal will not become a source of growing irritation between Latin America and the United States. We look forward to practical solutions in those two cases and to rational and balanced formulas. The case of Panama affects the dignity for all the countries of Latin America.\\n170.\\tInternational solidarity is inconceivable without a world disarmament system and without the extension of denuclearized zones, concerning which Latin America sets a precedent. The peaceful use of nuclear energy is an opportunity not to be wasted, and my country is interested in increasing the possibilities of its development. But we do not forget that the provisions of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII), annex] must be made more comprehensive. Nuclear energy should be used under stable, assured conditions, and any prohibition tending to avoid abuse will be welcome. Means of mass destruction must be subject to controls to protect mankind from the risk they represent. The United Nations must tackle boldly one of the most dramatic problems that can affect the international rule of law: the nuclear threat. Dire warnings to that effect have been heard at this Assembly. The use of nuclear energy should be subject to reliable control so that its peaceful use may not unexpectedly be turned into an instrument of aggression. The strength of this Organization depends largely in the future on the means of inspection and control that may be developed to deal with the nuclear threat. In this matter no warnings or scruples could ever be exaggerated. Nuclear non-proliferation, like disarmament, must become an accomplished fact. It is also necessary, as a practical formula, to study the relationship that should exist between the gross national product of a country and its expenditure on weapons.\\n171.\\tDisarmament will not create Utopia, but it presupposes the development of a policy and of action.\\n172.\\tThe maturity being shown by the international community is undeniable. That is why it is important for each country to be convinced that regional conflicts are factors not only of local disturbance, but of contagious, world-wide unrest. Fortunately, it is now possible to envisage world peace in practical terms. Peace is no longer merely an abstract ideal, an illusion or a hope, but a necessity originating largely in the forces of development which the world society has created in recent years. International confrontation increasingly becomes so costly a risk that it is possible and more realistic to explore and exploit the definite alternative of peaceful coexistence. Peace is no longer an ideal, it is a real political possibility.\\n173 In the years to come I think we should be engaged in accelerating in the world the processes of political democratization and of greater participation by citizens in the decisions of society. Similarly, efforts must be intensified to assert the value and dignity of human existence. In this respect the United Nations has achieved much undeniable progress, but a great deal remains to be done. Venezuela, as a democratic nation, is fully aware of the importance of these values.\\n174.\\tSimilarly, we must think of the action necessary to control the phenomena of violence of any and all types, and all their manifestations. Some of these phenomena originate in economic imbalances or centuries-old injustices. But political solutions will be necessary, and the time is right to devise them and plan for them.\\n175.\\tAll this, in short, leads us to affirm that the condition of mankind and of the ethical forces of individual and social conduct will prevail over the distortions and mutilations that industrialized civilization has developed. World order can be based on mankind, and mankind alone. The trust, hope and optimism we invest in the United Nations therefore raise these essential questions: Can we be optimistic about the future of mankind, or is it necessary to remain motionless? Can the present be changed? Is it possible to raise the idea of justice in political and ethical terms? And do we or do we not accept the fact that the condition of mankind is based on freedom and the free exercise of man's creative powers? To that end we must rescue the irreplaceable principle of international honesty from wreck.\\n176.\\tVenezuela is a country which believes in and identifies with the fundamental values of human life, democracy and freedom, and we wish to reaffirm that in international controversies or dissension we are willing to listen and to understand. As a nation of Latin America and of the third world, we hope that our motives will be understood; that our dignity will be valued, for it is not incompatible with the dignity of any other country; and that our word will be respected as an expression of good faith.\\n177.\\tThere are two ways to conclude an address to the General Assembly: with pessimism or with optimism. I conclude my statement with optimism.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Everything that could be said has been said\\nduring this annual routine, in which each Head of State or\\nGovernment, or Minister, stands before the United Nations\\nGeneral Assembly. If all the speeches were to be published\\nin a compendium, the same universal themes would be\\nrepeated a thousand times.\\nThe compendium would include the great, insoluble\\nproblems that, to various degrees, afflict the peoples of\\nevery continent, as well as the solutions that have already\\nbeen found, and the promised solutions implicit in the\\nconstant efforts of this Organization, which, like any other\\nhuman endeavour, has lived through 50 years of triumphs\\nand frustration.\\nWe must rejoice that, thanks to the Organization’s\\nvigilance and action, we have enjoyed — as never\\nbefore — half a century of peace, although we lament the\\nfact that we must now deploy efforts against violence born\\nof intolerance, fanaticism and ethnic or religious strife that\\nfrustrate the achievement of the harmony for which\\nmankind yearns.\\nAlongside the impressive achievements of the world\\ncommunity, these 50 years have also seen numerous local\\nconflicts that have taken 23 million lives. Eighty seven per\\ncent of the weapons sold and used in the world come from\\nthe five countries that are permanent members of the\\nSecurity Council. And, unbelievable as it might seem, at\\nthis stage of our political evolution, two atomic Powers\\nare causing anxiety with inexplicable nuclear tests for\\nwhich we criticized other Powers.\\nBut who can deny that in the fields of health,\\ntechnology, environment, human rights, communications,\\nthe exploitation of the resources of the seas and many\\nother fields, there is progress and hope, and at least a\\nwarning that awakens the universal conscience?\\nToday’s statement by the Foreign Minister of\\nVenezuela will be no different. Political scenarios change,\\nas do ideologies, the most extraordinary crisis in history\\nerupts, but life’s dramas continue, with man bruised by\\nchange, but for the first time wavering between hope and\\nbewilderment. This situation results from the fact that we\\nhave rushed from one era to another without the\\ndemolition caused by war, although we have had the\\nenthusiastic and confident contribution of students and\\nworkers, who have devoted their free time to making it.\\nWe note hardly any curiosity about the era we are\\napproaching, an era as yet unnamed, though soon to be\\nupon us it could be called anything: “post-capitalist”,\\n“post-socialist” or “post-industrial”; or it could simply be\\ndescribed as a time of transition between two periods that\\nour generations share.\\nThere has been talk, of course, of the end of history,\\nwith the end of ideological confrontation; that is precisely\\nwhat makes history: incessant conflicts and passionate\\nconfrontations, fears and hopes, freedom and deprivation\\nof freedom, in any of the forms of oppression that have\\nalways been applied.\\nMan today has the vague feeling that he is in contact\\nwith all other men through the miracle of the media, fibre\\noptics, and cybernetic systems, and yet, now that there are\\nmore human beings with whom solidarity may be felt,\\nsolidarity is more precarious and man’s loneliness is more\\npoignant.\\nTo create a different world based on a solid,\\ncomplex and long-lasting Organization that has been\\ntaking shape since the end of the First World War, we\\nhave begun to talk — since we want words to describe\\nwhat is going on — of globalization, of integration, of the\\nabolition of the nation-State and its replacement by large\\nblocs, in order to produce through strength of numbers\\nand unity a new dynamic different from military might.\\n8\\n\\n\\nLet us suppose, then, that the world of the future will\\nhave to be shaped according to regions, or large integrated\\ngroups or communities, regional or otherwise, that have a\\ncommon cultural origin and wish to be identified with the\\nothers, because of the particular characteristics of their\\nculture, such as tradition, language, religion and even mixed\\nblood.\\nThis is what strikes me, as I now appear for the first\\ntime before so distinguished a forum to speak on behalf of\\na country such as mine — a country with a modest\\neconomy, a small population, a territory that is\\nmedium-sized but which, owing to its excellent\\ngeographical situation, developed more than others; a\\nculture of social freedom, of mixed races and of political\\nindependence, achieved by means of an epic struggle, not\\nonly for itself but for all of its American neighbours. Mine\\nis a country that has never been at war with anyone, a\\ncountry whose desire to see its neighbours freed from\\ncolonialism gave impetus to, and is inspiring, the brand-new\\nCaribbean community, for instance. It is a country that, as\\nwe have proved time and again, will support and promote\\nany initiative aimed at pacification in the region, as we did\\ntoday in the Group of Friends of Guatemala, for example,\\nand when we welcomed the latest agreement between Israel\\nand the Palestinians.\\nVenezuela, like other countries, has been shaken — in\\nour case since 1989 — by a severe crisis. Not so much\\neconomic or political as ethical in nature, this crisis has\\nweakened our institutions and undermined our financial\\nsystem, the collapse of which cost us 16 per cent of our\\ngross national product and has attracted the\\nnot-always-understanding attention of international opinion.\\nThis is the crisis that our Government inherited.\\nAware that its characteristics are atypical in our region,\\nsince its basic goal is to replace a paternalistic, oil-\\ndependent model by an open culture based on work and\\nself-reliance rather than on seeking the understanding of\\nother countries, our Government is proceeding to solve our\\nnation’s problems, which, fortunately, are no match for our\\ndiverse and solid economic resources.\\nVenezuela is a country that has simultaneously — as\\nif by magic — produced great thinkers, the most credible\\nUtopians, the luckiest generals, the most visionary\\neducators. My country, situated at the northern gate of\\nSouth America, freed itself and other countries by following\\nthe dreams of Francisco de Miranda, brought to fruition by\\nSimón Bolivár and Antonio José de Sucre, by systematic\\nthinking and by the actions of Andrés Bello and Simón\\nRodríguez, among other well-known figures.\\nSimón Bolívar was clear-sighted. In that nebulous\\nperiod of history that was the year 1815, he set out, from\\nJamaica — in the most famous political document of this\\npart of the world — a dazzling prophecy of what the\\nideal destiny of Hispanic America was to be. To this day,\\nno one can understand how he thought it up. He wrote:\\n“It is a grandiose idea to try to make of the entire\\nnew world a single nation, with only one link to\\nbind and tie together all the parts to the whole.”\\nOnce independence was achieved, he foresaw that an\\nimperfect and erratic unity, such as that of the South,\\ncould be thrown off balance by the organization of the\\nformer 13 American colonies, whose integration he\\nalready anticipated. He also foresaw the power of the\\nhard-working, driven race that would consolidate on the\\nAmerican continent the formidable and admirable nation\\nthat the United States has become, with its transcendent\\nand unique feeling of liberty, since its founders left\\nbehind all prejudices and fears.\\nBolívar visualized uniting the American half that\\nwas discovered, populated and moulded in all its aspects\\nby Spain and Portugal, seeing it as one that must\\nnecessarily have its own way of life and of behaving. His\\nvision was never based on rivalry, but rather, in keeping\\nwith his views on the destiny of this shared hemisphere,\\non the basis of emulation and friendship instead of strife\\nas its driving force.\\nThe colonizing Powers contributed, and based this\\nhalf of America on, all they had brought with them. They\\nestablished a religion, a society reminiscent of the\\noffspring of settlers, whose physical surroundings and\\nindiscriminate crossbreeding gave rise to a feeling of\\nunfettered freedom and equality. This, in turn, engendered\\nirrevocably an equally free spirit of social democracy,\\nwhich Latin America has never since lacked, not even\\nduring the long periods when political democracy was\\nnon-existent.\\nIn 1826, Bolívar, the Liberator, convened the\\nCongress of Panama to speak there, for the first time in\\nhistory, not of sacred or profane alliances of war, but of\\nalliances for peace. The thoughts he presented gave rise\\nto the idea of an organized international community, first\\nof all for the Americas, through the Pan-American Union,\\nwhich in turn gave rise to the present Organization of\\n9\\n\\n\\nAmerican States (OAS), then to the League of Nations and\\nfinally to this Organization, which has given humanity,\\ntogether with peace, all the possibilities that peace offers.\\nThis is an exceptional community, the largest in the\\nworld, since it extends from the southern border of the\\nUnited States all the way south to Patagonia, uniting the\\ngreatest number of peoples and republics with similar\\ncharacteristics. Here, the various languages spoken in Spain\\nfortunately became one, revitalizing the Castilian tongue,\\nand similarly, the Portuguese language, which in Brazil is\\na language as open and soft as America itself. In the\\nnorthernmost point of America, the imprint of France in\\nCanada, as well as the Hispanic minority in the United\\nStates, are living reminders of this community.\\nIn geographical terms, we are larger than other official\\ncommunities, since the United States’ surface area covers\\n9,372,000 square kilometres and Europe’s covers\\n10,404,000 square kilometres. But we cover 20,000,000\\nsquare kilometres, and in these, the future of humanity is\\npulsing.\\nIn political and spiritual terms, we are history’s largest\\nlaboratory, at once a mystery and a promise — an absolute\\nwonder that the future is revealing day by day. The seed of\\na new world, different from our expectations, is growing\\namong us.\\nWe are not the only five hundred million human\\nbeings to be allergic to the discrimination that will confront\\nus in the year 2000. But we are the only human group to\\nhave been born and moulded without privileges, hesitations\\nor complexes, on an equal footing. Though this sense of\\nequality was repressed for three centuries by pragmatic\\nmeasures that were respected but not implemented, and by\\nthe extreme zeal of monks who consulted no one in\\nimposing a single faith on this immense geographical area,\\nit was imbued with the spaciousness of the land, the rivers,\\nthe forests, the gentle climate, the mountains and prairies,\\nwhose influence produced a different type of human\\ncharacter. And I would repeat that this deep feeling and\\nsense of fundamental freedom was something that had\\nnever happened to any other group of people.\\nGermán Arciniegas rightly said that\\n“America was colonized by a man who was destined\\nto a life of servitude in Europe. He became\\nemancipated when he crossed from one shore to the\\nother ... These wretches worked the continent with\\ntheir bare hands, they were the poor, the landless, the\\nilliterate of the popular Renaissance. Uneducated,\\nunenlightened, their common destiny was to join\\ntogether to become nations and so achieve justice.”\\nAnd justice was the most absolute independence,\\ninfluenced by American determinism.\\nIn his sociologist’s discourse, Bolívar said that we\\nAmericans represent a small human race. We have now\\nbecome an important branch of the broader human race:\\nthe branch of possibilities and hope.\\nOur region would not enter into conflict with any\\nother; not even with the one with which it shares the\\nhemisphere, and which speaks a different language and\\nhas different customs. It will not be another international\\nagency, or form another bureaucracy, or take up more\\nroom than the enormous space of its present physical and\\nhuman geography.\\nIn other words, we aspire to a beautiful Utopia, with\\nno other pragmatism than the pride of being a Utopia\\nwith ever more solidarity; part of the universe with shared\\nvalues, in search of the same destiny.\\nIf other continents fashion communities around\\nreligious, racial or geopolitical banners, it is natural that\\nwe, Latin Americans, put forth ours with our own\\nimmense, protean sense of unity.\\nThere was a time, as we followed a different cultural\\npattern, when we had a more orderly society and enjoyed\\npolitical systems that brought us fame throughout the\\nworld. Practically all Latin American countries\\nexperienced a sort of golden age of culture and politics,\\nmarked by originality. We created literature. We forged\\nour own laws with our own institutions. We pioneered the\\nLaw of the Sea; we produced the first system against\\nnuclear weapons, with the Treaty of Tlatelolco.\\nA concerted Latin American community of nations\\nwould tend to recuperate and exchange training and\\neducational systems capable of affirming our collective\\npride and personality, as Europe has already done, despite\\nthe diversity of its components, out of fear of the return\\nof thousands of years of violence. Morally, the Latin\\nAmerican community would be equal to the commercial\\nand economic commitments made through ALADI, the\\nLatin American Integration Association, as well as the\\nAndean Pact, the Central American Common Market and\\nMERCOSUR, all designed to form a front of solidarity\\n10\\n\\n\\nand a crucial link in the economic integration of the\\nuniverse.\\nA conscious Latin American community of nations\\nwould guarantee the sustainable development of the world’s\\nmost varied and richest ecological systems, and would\\nconceive not only of the larger spaces, but also of the\\nimportance of drinking water, of mining resources, and of\\nthe most varied and richest flora and fauna on the face of\\nthe earth.\\nOf course, we bring before the United Nations the\\nmany concerns that we have expressed about the fate of our\\nOrganization which, in its 50 years of arbitrating peace, has\\ncharted a new path for the peoples it represents. These\\nconcerns have prompted talk of reforming the Charter, in\\norder for the Security Council, for instance, to take up and\\nrepresent new geopolitical realities, and not only military\\nmight. This is the spirit in which my country, through the\\nvoice of its President, Rafael Caldera, has realistically and\\nfrankly proposed that Brazil be the permanent\\nrepresentative of Latin America in an enlarged Security\\nCouncil. We have also spoken of the justification of\\nagencies and powers, to make the cost of peace less\\nburdensome; of the urgent need to adapt the Economic and\\nSocial Council to the necessities of our time, as well as the\\nCouncil for Culture, Science and Technology, that is still\\nthe monopoly of industrialized centres. If a common market\\nfor technology were to be established, we would be truly\\nkeeping pace with history.\\nIn America, although less than in Africa and Asia, we\\ntoo are disturbed by the growing marginalization, the social\\ninjustice, the poverty bordering on famine, the insecurity\\nexacerbated by the trade in illicit drugs and its\\nconsequences, which we witness. We produce terrible drugs\\nin ever greater quantities to satisfy the voracity of the\\nconsumer markets. But, at the same time, we fight this\\nscourge with the greatest tenacity and determination.\\nOur community has had the virtue of becoming\\npractically a breeding ground for democracy, thanks to the\\nsteadfastness of its leaders and thinkers, as well as of the\\noldest but least championed regional organization. We must\\nnow see to it that democracy is purged of its dishonesty,\\nand is cleansed. To this end, at the Hemispheric Summit in\\nMiami, my Government proposed, with unanimous support,\\nto put a stop to the impunity of corruption.\\nWe consider that drug trafficking and political\\ncorruption are linked together by money laundering, under\\nthe cover of electoral contributions.\\nIf democracy is to acquire a new respectability, it\\nwill be thanks to the common, concerted effort of\\nAmerica; an effort which this world Organization will\\nalso be called upon to make in the near future. That is\\nbecause political corruption, a manifestation of the\\nuniversal mafia, is not exclusive to our region and must\\nbe fought at the global level, just like illicit drug\\ntrafficking.\\nVery shortly, a world congress against corruption\\nwill be held in China, doubtless inspired by our example.\\nWe hold out great expectations for that congress. Indeed,\\nwe are keenly interested in anything that is sponsored and\\nadvanced by this Organization.\\nBut I wanted to put before the Assembly the\\nsomewhat romantic idea of a Latin American Utopia, that\\nit might inspire confidence in our neighbours in this\\nhemisphere and hope in all other regions, whether on an\\norganized basis or not. This is the spirit in which the Rio\\nGroup has endorsed the oft-repeated proposal for a Latin\\nAmerican Parliament.\\nSince the first Great War there has been a\\ndislocation in Europe, which conveyed itself through\\nSpain and Portugal; its aesthetic sense of life and\\nexistence through Italy; its modes of thought and\\nphilosophy through France; its political models through\\nGreat Britain and its lasting technologies through\\nGermany. A regrettable dislocation occurred between\\nEurope and Latin America, which is truly its most\\nkindred continent, where we live as distant cousins, and\\nstill the most vibrant and promising offshoot of this\\nlineage.\\nIf we underscore the need to encourage this idea of\\nour community, it is because it exists, in fact, although it\\nis now beset with social problems that require combined\\ntreatment. It also has a legalist existence, since States\\nsuch as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Uruguay and\\nVenezuela have incorporated it into their political\\nconstitutions.\\nThe greatest tragedy of Latin America is its social\\ncondition, because of the imbalances characteristic of any\\nlarge society — irregularities in family patterns,\\ndeficiencies in education, the destruction of homes due to\\na lack of ethics — even housing, which was never one of\\nour biggest problems, has become one, because it is\\nlinked to a sense of ethics at the family level. They are\\ninseparably linked.\\n11\\n\\n\\nWe could say, along with Arturo Uslar Pietri that,\\ncaught as we are between the millstones that grind the\\npolitical universe, we have given more thought to building\\nrepublics than to perfecting the nation that we are.\\nIn spite of all its faults, the United Nations — the\\nOrganization we aspired to and wish to maintain — has\\ncreated a civilization. It is responsible for over 300\\ninternational treaties: for the consolidation of democracy;\\nfor the dedicated protection of refugees; for self-\\ndetermination, freedom, independence, the dignity of life,\\nthe arts, traditions; for coexistence — even if the phantoms\\nof intolerance reappear; for trade free of protectionism; for\\nchildren, women and our indigenous populations. And this,\\nbeyond civilization, we can call the new culture of the\\nhuman family.\\nThe Organization has grown and expanded since 1945,\\nand the world with it. Its many offspring, scattered among\\nthe five continents and virtually all of them free, have led\\nto a membership quadruple the number of the founding\\nMembers, among them Venezuela, which was represented\\nthen by its great Minister Caracciolo Parra Pérez. At that\\ntime he voiced an idea that has even greater validity today:\\n“The peoples of the world must know each other\\nmorally and spiritually before they can manage to\\ndispel the distrust and ignorance which keep them\\napart. We must build up a kind of intellectual\\nnetwork, above the network of the physical\\ncommunications system which exists between nations,\\nor parallel to it.” (Official Records of the United\\nNations Conference on International Organization, 7th\\nplenary meeting, p. 23)\\nThis Organization’s greatest achievement has been to\\noffer the world a span of half a century during which,\\ndespite remaining fears, it could think of a new course for\\nharmonizing all aspects of the life of societies with the\\nnature that shelters those societies.\\nI congratulate the Organization and the President of\\nthe General Assembly, Mr. Diego Freitas do Amaral, in the\\nhope that under his leadership the Organization will achieve\\nall the success it deserves and needs. All races, all\\nreligions, all the most varied shades of humankind bring\\ntheir aspirations and their claims here. This is an spacious\\nhome that has always endeavoured to live in the peace that\\nis and must be the normal condition of life. It has been said\\nthat if health is the peace of the body, peace is the health\\nof peoples. In that connection, the pre-Socratic philosopher\\nwrote that in times of peace people awake to the crowing\\nof roosters, while in times of war they waken to the\\nclamour of arms; in peace the young bury the old, while\\nin war the old bury the young.\\n',\n",
       " 'Mankind is increasingly feeling the winds\\nof the twenty-first century. What they bring depends on\\nall of us, on whether or not we succeed in responding\\ncollectively to new challenges and in establishing a\\nreliable system of international security and stability once\\nwe have overcome the vices, antagonisms and stereotypes\\naccumulated during the century about to end.\\nThis is not only possible, it is the imperative of our\\ntimes!\\nA well-known Russian proverb says, â€œIf you would\\nlive in the world, live in peaceâ€\\x9d. It contains a highly\\nphilosophical message of everlasting value. Mankind will\\nlive in peace and harmony once it has learned to resolve\\nemerging problems through peaceful, political means.\\nStates will live in peace and harmony once they have\\nrecognized their interrelationship and interdependence and\\nstarted to seek collective responses to the challenges of\\ntheir times.\\nExperience confirms the truth of this popular\\nwisdom. The most recent example is the sharp\\naggravation of the world monetary and financial crisis\\nwhich has besieged many countries, including Russia,\\nwhich is undergoing sweeping economic reforms. The\\ncurrent upheaval in the world financial markets can be\\novercome only by joint efforts that do not pursue\\nunilateral advantages and are intended to ensure global\\neconomic stability. Interaction of States in this process,\\nincluding within the framework of the United Nations,\\nmust, on principle, be raised to a new level.\\nAs for Russia, after overcoming an acute political\\ncrisis, the countryâs President, Boris N. Yeltsin, the\\nGovernment and the leading political forces are making\\nvigorous efforts to stabilize the economic and financial\\nsituation. This is not an easy task, but the solution will be\\nfound.\\nFrom this rostrum I pledge that Russia will not\\ndeviate from the path of reform and will do its best to\\npass with dignity this most difficult test, so as not only to\\npreserve the democratic progress that has been made but\\nalso to augment it.\\nLikewise, Russiaâs foreign policy will remain\\nconsistent and constructive. It is firmly geared towards\\nbuilding a democratic multipolar world, ensuring\\ninteraction with other States in the interests of settling\\ninternational problems by political means and developing\\nbroad, mutually beneficial cooperation in all areas.\\n20\\n\\n\\nWe are convinced that the problems before the world,\\nno matter how complex they may be, can be solved on the\\nbasis of strict observance of international law and close\\ninteraction among States. Multilateral organizations and\\nmechanisms have a special role to play in this respect.\\nAbove all, this applies to the United Nations, which\\ncontinues to be the sole universal international\\npeacekeeping organization and is thus better equipped than\\nany other world body to reach agreements on how to settle\\nconflicts, as well as to identify and remove the underlying\\nsocial and economic causes. It is important for United\\nNations efforts to be reinforced by support from regional\\norganizations.\\nWe highly value the level of interaction that now\\nexists between the United Nations and the Organization for\\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), acting as a\\nreliable partner in addressing complex European problems,\\nas well as interaction with the Organization of African\\nUnity (OAU) and other regional organizations, including\\nthe Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The\\ninternational community has developed a unique arsenal of\\npolitical and diplomatic tools intended for the resolution of\\nevery international problem. It must be put to effective use.\\nCoercive actions constitute exceptional methods of last\\nresort. Their use must be strictly regulated by the rules of\\ninternational law and above all by the United Nations\\nCharter. In other words, we advocate invoking the force of\\nlaw rather than the law of force in international affairs.\\nThe fact that the Iraqi crisis which erupted earlier this\\nyear was settled precisely by political means, through the\\njoint efforts of many States and the initiatives launched by\\nthe United Nations Secretary-General, provided graphic\\nevidence that the potential inherent in constructive and\\nactive diplomacy is by far more efficient than relying\\nexclusively on military force.\\nA new outbreak of tensions around Iraq has made us\\ndeeply concerned, since it is fraught with serious\\nconsequences for regional and international stability. No\\ndoubt Iraq must fully travel its part of the road, resume full\\ncooperation with the United Nations Special Commission\\nand the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and\\nimplement relevant Security Council resolutions. On the\\nother hand, the Security Council must adequately assess the\\nsituation related to the elimination of Iraqâs weapons of\\nmass destruction and answer the question of whether or not\\nthat country still poses a threat to regional and overall\\ninternational security after seven years of work carried out\\nthere by United Nations inspectors. Concerted action by the\\nworld community is required today to finally unblock this\\ncrisis situation.\\nPolitical logic must prevail over the logic of force in\\nour search for ways to settle the explosive conflict in\\nKosovo. The use of tools of coercion to resolve the\\nKosovo conflict might lead to a major war with\\nunpredictable consequences for the Balkan region and\\nEurope at large. It is our firm belief that a political\\nsolution is the only possible way of settling the problem\\nof Kosovo, granting it broad autonomy and ensuring strict\\nrespect for the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic\\nof Yugoslavia.\\nThe bloodshed in Afghanistan continues in spite of\\nthe fact that, as experience has shown, only temporary\\ngains can be obtained in that country through the use of\\narms. Rather, it is only through a persistent search for\\npolitical solutions, with the United Nations playing a\\ncentral role, that genuine stabilization, real settlement,\\nformation of an efficient central Government recognized\\nby all Afghans and, finally, assurance of Afghanistanâs\\nterritorial integrity and independence can realistically be\\naccomplished.\\nCollective political efforts are required to give a\\nsecond wind to the Middle East peace process. In our\\nview, it is not so much the absence of fresh ideas or\\nproposals but rather the upsetting of the balance that has\\nstymied progress on all the negotiating tracks. It should\\nnot be ignored that even if the Middle East process has\\nlong-term objectives, it also has its time limits. Russia has\\nconsistently advocated the establishment of an\\nindependent Palestinian State through political means and\\nnegotiations. It is only in this way that the inalienable\\nrights of the Palestinians to self-determination and reliable\\nassurance of Israelâs legitimate security interests can be\\nrealized.\\nIn a parallel move, talks must be resumed on the\\nSyrian and Lebanese tracks, building on the results\\nalready achieved.\\nThe recently proposed settlement of the Lockerbie\\ncase has been a major accomplishment of the international\\ncommunity. The adoption by the Security Council of a\\nrelevant resolution was possible due to the constructive\\napproach taken by the parties concerned â€” the United\\nStates, Great Britain, France and Libya â€” as well as due\\nto diplomatic efforts by many international organizations,\\nwhich were supported by Russia. It is essential to proceed\\nwithout delay to its implementation.\\n21\\n\\n\\nArguably, similar perseverance must be shown in the\\nefforts to break the deadlock in the Cyprus settlement. The\\nUnited Nations must play a leading role to this end.\\nFailure of the international community to fully\\nextinguish any one of the long-standing local conflicts in\\nAfrica in recent years is a source of growing concern.\\nMoreover, new flash points of tension have emerged on that\\ncontinent. It must be admitted that so far attempts to\\nachieve full coordination between the United Nations and\\nAfricaâs regional organizations have not succeeded. That is\\nwhy the upcoming Security Council ministerial meeting on\\nAfrica should focus on shaping a strong common stance\\ncapable of radically reversing the negative dynamics of\\nAfricaâs latest developments.\\nFor objective reasons, Russia has paid special attention\\nto settlement of conflict situations in the CIS. Whether in\\nAbkhazia, South Ossetia, Nagorno-Karabakh, Tajikistan or\\nTrans-Dniestria, our country has but one objective â€”\\nnamely, promoting a political settlement and helping build\\nlasting peace. As requested by the sides concerned, Russia\\nhas undertaken a difficult peace-building mission and is\\ndoing all it can to bring it to fruition. But the effort can\\nprove unavailing unless the parties in conflict show\\ngoodwill and a constructive attitude and also receive more\\nmeaningful international backing, above all from the United\\nNations and the OSCE.\\nWhile making strong efforts to settle regional crises,\\nwe should not lose sight of global problems, some of which\\nhave acquired a new dimension in the last year.\\nWe cannot but feel concerned over the emergence of\\na real threat in the form of the proliferation of nuclear\\nweapons throughout the planet. It is a common task of the\\ninternational community to encourage all countries to\\naccede both to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of\\nNuclear Weapons and to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\\nBan Treaty. We welcome Brazilâs accession to the Non-\\nProliferation Treaty.\\nRussia is committed to the idea of continued reduction\\nof nuclear weapon arsenals and the maintenance of strategic\\nstability at lower armament levels. In this context, we\\nattach particularly great importance to the Russian-\\nAmerican interaction in the area of reducing strategic\\noffensive arms. In the course of his appointment hearings,\\nMr. Yevgeny M. Primakov, Chairman of the Russian\\nGovernment, expressed his firm resolve a few days ago to\\nseek early ratification by the State Duma of the START II\\nTreaty. Likewise, it is important for the United States to\\nratify all documents related to START II.\\nAccession of the other nuclear Powers to the nuclear\\narms control process is now on the agenda. We urge\\ncareful consideration of a proposal made by President\\nBoris Yeltsin that calls on the nuclear Powers to deploy\\nnuclear weapons exclusively within the boundaries of\\ntheir national territories. We note with satisfaction the\\nrecent consensus decision in the Conference on\\nDisarmament to start negotiations banning production of\\nnuclear-weapon-grade fissionable materials. What is of\\nspecial significance is that the decision was supported by\\nStates that are not yet parties to the Treaty on the Non-\\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, among others. We are\\nconvinced that such a ban would be a further necessary\\nstep in multilateral efforts to enhance the non-proliferation\\nregime and nuclear disarmament.\\nThe nuclear threat has many faces. Today, nuclear\\nterrorism can also be a source of that threat. What seemed\\nto be science fiction yesterday can now, much to our\\nregret, become a reality. Hence, strong action by the\\ninternational community is required to prevent the real-\\nlife emergence of that new form of terrorism.\\nAccelerating work on a draft convention to combat acts\\nof nuclear terrorism, submitted by our country so that it\\ncan be adopted by the General Assembly at the current\\nsession, has become particularly relevant.\\nRussia has repeatedly stated at the highest level its\\nfirm opposition to terrorism in all its forms and\\nmanifestations. International terrorism is one of the most\\ndangerous global challenges to international stability. It\\ncan be successfully combated only through united action\\nby all States. Indeed, only by acting together instead of\\nmaking unilateral power moves, shall we be able to\\nsucceed in our fight against that most dangerous of evils.\\nMilitant separatism has become another factor that\\ndestabilizes international relations. Relying exclusively on\\nextremist methods in the struggle for the national rights\\nof minority groups within multinational States, separatism\\noften finds itself in league with terrorism and religious\\nfanaticism. Separatism inevitably provokes internal\\nconflicts in which neighbouring countries frequently get\\ninvolved, thereby setting the stage for stoking regional\\ncrises.\\nMore than two and a half thousand national\\nminorities live in 150 countries of the world. Were all of\\nthem to aspire to a State entity of their own, the\\ndisastrous and catastrophic consequences could easily be\\nimagined. Those who foment separatism should keep that\\nin mind.\\n22\\n\\n\\nThe fight against drugs also requires joint, concerted\\naction. We must focus on the practical implementation of\\nthe relevant decisions aimed at combating the drug threat\\nadopted by the General Assembly at its special session.\\nThe international community should take a common\\nstand in implementing the provisions of the Universal\\nDeclaration of Human Rights, whose fiftieth anniversary\\noccurs this year. In this area, too, resolute joint action is\\nneeded in respect of those States which, under various\\npretexts, violate generally recognized human rights and\\nfreedoms. There can be no tolerance of double standards\\ninvolving attempts to shield those who elevate to the level\\nof Government policy discrimination against a part of the\\npopulation. Russia cannot and will not remain indifferent to\\nthe fate of hundreds of thousands of Russian-speaking\\ncitizens subjected to harsh repressive measures in Latvia\\nand Estonia. The international community, and above all the\\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,\\nshould closely watch the situation in those countries.\\nI have touched upon a few of the important issues\\nwhich the United Nations is called upon to deal with at this\\ntime. It continues to play its unique role as facilitator of\\njoint efforts by States to strengthen peace and security, deal\\nwith urgent issues and meet new global challenges. To that\\nend, it is necessary to improve United Nations mechanisms\\nand adapt them to todayâs needs. That is exactly what the\\nprocess of reforming the United Nations, launched by\\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, seeks to accomplish. The\\nrationale behind it is enhanced efficiency for the\\nOrganization.\\nThat is the angle from which we approach the ongoing\\ndiscussion on the work of the Security Council. No one\\nshould question the Security Councilâs primary\\nresponsibility under the Charter for the maintenance of\\npeace and security. It is extremely important to preserve its\\neffectiveness and its efficiency in decision-making, as well\\nas to build on internal cohesion and work coordination\\nmethods developed in recent years.\\nI should like to reaffirm that we support the\\nimplementation of reforms and changes in United Nations\\nmechanisms that will promote effective consolidation of the\\nUnited Nations and improve its activities. Among the steps\\ntaken to that end I wish to mention adoption, under United\\nNations auspices, of the Statute of the International\\nCriminal Court. Russiaâs initiative to launch a discussion on\\nways to achieve international information security serves\\nthe same goal. In essence, our proposal is intended to offset\\nthreats inherent in the use of the latest advances in science\\nand technology for purposes incompatible with the\\nmaintenance of international security.\\nI wish to single out a dangerous tendency: that of\\nadapting the United Nations to meet the requirements of\\nan individual State, or of replacing it altogether as, for\\nexample, in the case of peacekeeping. What I have in\\nmind are attempts to undercut the powers of the Security\\nCouncil, as laid down in the Charter, to use coercive\\nmeasures. We must not allow a precedent to be created\\ninvolving the use of military potential in a crisis situation\\nwithout the consent of the Security Council. Surely it is\\nobvious that such actions could lead to a serious erosion\\nof the existing system of international relations, whose\\ncentral element is the United Nations.\\nUnited Nations sanctions as an instrument of\\ninternational coercion also require a highly balanced\\napproach. When introduced by the Security Council,\\nsanctions should not become a tool to fight a regime that\\nmay be disliked. Sanctions should not make people suffer.\\nThey should not destabilize the economic situation in the\\ncountry subjected to sanctions or in the adjacent region.\\nIt is time to fine-tune the mechanism regulating the\\nimposition of sanctions and their duration and the\\nprocedures for easing and lifting them.\\nIn short, individual elements of the United Nations\\nmechanism need improvement and retooling. But we\\nshould go about it with a full sense of responsibility,\\nmindful of the medical professionâs rule that unnecessary\\nharm is to be avoided at all costs.\\nEvery session of the General Assembly is, in a way,\\na milestone event. Each session is expected to make a\\ntangible contribution to the resolution of acute problems\\nconfronting mankind. It will depend on all of us whether\\nor not the fifty-third session of the General Assembly\\nlives up to the expectations and hopes we place in it. It\\nwill depend on all of us whether or not joint effective\\nsteps are taken to lead us to a more stable, peaceful\\nworld, a world free from war and conflict and from\\nfinancial and economic upheaval, a world built on the\\nprinciples of democracy and multi-polarity. Russia stands\\nready to work with others to attain these goals.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'There is no doubt that the twentieth century, which is now\\ncoming to a close, will leave a deep imprint on the history\\nof the world. This has been an epoch of global\\ntransformation and social change, scientific discoveries and\\nachievements. The realization of the idea of a universal\\nworld Organization, which has become the foundation\\nuniting the entire international community, has indeed been\\none of the positive things about this century.\\nHowever, the twentieth century has witnessed the most\\nsevere upheavals. Millions of people have perished in the\\nflames of world wars, revolutions and civil and ethnic\\nconflicts. On a few occasions, humanity teetered on the\\nbrink of self-destruction, and the burden of outstanding\\nproblems it has left for the new era is a heavy one. We\\ncannot resolve all these problems before the advent of the\\nthird millennium, but we are indeed duty bound to lay\\ndown the foundations for resolving them in the long-term\\nand to start moving in that direction.\\nThe most important thing we should do is to define\\nthe parameters of the world in which we are going to live.\\nThis lies at the core of the initiative put forward by the\\nPresident of the Russian Federation, President Yeltsin, to\\ndevelop a world concept for the twenty-first century. As a\\nworld Power and permanent member of the Security\\nCouncil, Russia is fully conscious of its special role in and\\nresponsibility for world developments and stands for the\\nestablishment of a multipolar world built on a solid\\nfoundation of international law. Our country is pursuing in\\npractice a multifaceted foreign policy with a view to\\nestablishing equitable and mutually beneficial bilateral and\\nmultilateral relations with all the countries of the world and\\nto strengthening international security and stability.\\nThe world concept for the twenty-first century\\ninvolves establishing a new culture which would aim to\\nform a common system of values and models of\\nbehaviour. A world without wars and conflict, a world of\\ndemocracy and prosperity must be the highest priority for\\nall peoples and States. Every nation is entitled to its\\nrightful place among other nations and to security on an\\nequal footing in all its aspects, including in the political,\\nmilitary, economic and social areas.\\nHow and through what mechanisms can this be\\nachieved? Is there a body which can reflect the interests\\nof all States in a balanced manner? The answer is\\nobvious: it is the United Nations. From the outset, the\\nUnited Nations Charter put the Organization at the service\\nof all humankind. There is simply no other universal\\nmechanism to regulate international relations.\\nWe are fully aware of the danger posed by the\\nthreats and challenges facing our world today: the various\\nmanifestations of militant nationalism, separatism,\\nterrorism and extremism, which know no borders. This is\\na common challenge which is claiming countless victims\\nand wreaking destruction in various parts of the globe.\\nAggressive separatism, which has become a growth\\nmedium for various extremist forces, has become one of\\nthe main sources of domestic conflict and regional\\ninstability. No one is immune to it. The international\\ncommunity and, above all, the United Nations, must\\ndecisively clamp down on any manifestations of\\nseparatism and strictly and consistently defend the\\nprinciples of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of\\nStates and the inviolability of their borders. Outside\\nencouragement and support for separatist forces must be\\ntotally eradicated.\\nRecently, separatism has been increasingly merging\\nwith the monster of terrorism. We could even now, during\\nthis session, take a number of specific steps to stimulate\\npractical international cooperation in combating terrorism.\\nWe must finalize the draft international convention on the\\nsuppression of acts of nuclear terrorism. I therefore\\nsuggest that we should develop and adopt a declaration of\\nprinciples for cooperation between States on combating\\nterrorism more vigorously. It is the States’ bounden duty\\nto protect their citizens against terrorist attacks and to\\nprevent activities from taking place in their territory that\\nare aimed at organizing such acts against the citizens of\\nother countries. Russia therefore supports the initiative to\\nconvene, under United Nations auspices, a conference or\\na special session of the General Assembly next year on\\n13\\n\\n\\ncombating terrorism. Such an event would give a powerful\\npolitical impetus to the struggle against terrorism at a global\\nlevel.\\nThe capabilities of the United Nations should also be\\nused more efficiently in the fight against drug-related\\nthreats and organized crime. Only through joint efforts that\\nare also in strict compliance with the rules of international\\nlaw can we defeat this evil.\\nThe founding fathers of the United Nations made\\nprovision for a law-based response to violations of peace\\nand security. The international community can take also\\ncoercive measures, but this should be done in accordance\\nwith the Charter and following a decision by the Security\\nCouncil. Unlawful means can only undermine rightful ends.\\nIt is from this very perspective that we assess such\\ndoctrines as that of humanitarian intervention. In general,\\nwe should take an extremely careful approach to coercive\\nmeasures; what is more, we must not allow them to turn\\ninto a repressive mechanism for influencing States and\\npeoples that are not to the liking of some.\\nOf course, evolution of the international situation\\nmeans that it is appropriate for existing rules of\\ninternational law to be developed and adapted to prevailing\\nconditions, but this should be done through collective\\ndiscussion and the adoption of appropriate decisions, not as\\na fait accompli and not working from scratch: it should be\\nbased on valid rules of international law. This is precisely\\nwhat Russia had in mind with its initiative to consider at\\nthe Millennium Summit legal aspects of the use of force in\\ninternational relations in the era of globalization. We invite\\nall countries to a broad and open dialogue on this issue.\\nMuch has been said in recent years about the reform\\nof the United Nations, which is only natural. Life is an\\nevolving process and, as times change, any system will\\nneed to be updated. What objectives future reform should\\npursue is another matter. In our view, reform means, first\\nand foremost, the adoption of a package of measures to\\nenhance the role of the United Nations in the world arena.\\nThe Organization should be ready to respond in a timely\\nand appropriate way to the challenges that globalization\\npresents to mankind. We must give serious thought to how\\nto enhance the efficiency of the Security Council and how\\nto make that principal organ of the United Nations more\\nrepresentative through the inclusion of influential new\\nmembers, including — and this is absolutely\\nindispensable — developing countries. This would help\\nmaintain the overall balance in the system of international\\nrelations, especially when the use of force, bypassing the\\nSecurity Council, continues. It is also beyond doubt that\\npreservation of the right of veto of permanent members\\nis indispensable for meaningful and efficient work in the\\nCouncil.\\nGenerally speaking, the entire system of international\\norganizations needs sensible and responsible reform. At\\nthe same time, the United Nations must remain a focal\\npoint of the international community’s efforts to settle the\\nmost burning problems of the day. The issue of\\nstrengthening the authority of the United Nations after it\\nhas been seriously and painfully tested by the Balkan and\\nIraq crises is at the very top of the agenda at the current\\nsession of the General Assembly. First of all, we must\\ncontinue strenuous efforts to restore the role of the\\nSecurity Council in world affairs.\\nWe have managed through joint efforts to bring the\\nsettlement of the Kosovo problem back within the legal\\nand political framework of the United Nations. Now we\\nneed jointly to strive for strict and consistent\\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 1244\\n(1999). We cannot afford to let the re-emerging political\\nprocess be undermined again, since that could become a\\ntragedy for all of Europe and could once again bring the\\nworld to the brink of catastrophe. Equally urgent is the\\nissue of post-conflict rehabilitation in the Balkans. The\\nUnited Nations has an important role to play in meeting\\nthese challenges as well.\\nWe all should draw serious lessons from recent\\ncrises. Non-legitimate methods of exerting power only\\nexacerbate problems and result in even greater deadlock.\\nDevelopments in the Middle East, where the peace\\nprocess has of late acquired a new positive impetus,\\nclearly exemplify the optimal alternative, that of\\nnegotiated settlement.\\nAlso on the agenda is the issue of improving\\nsanctions regimes, to which the international community\\nhas frequently resorted over the past decade. Sanctions\\nare an extreme measure. They must be applied only when\\nother means of political influence have been exhausted\\nand when the Security Council has established the\\nexistence of a threat to peace. The Council, for its part,\\nshould be guided by clear criteria for the imposition and\\nthe lifting of sanctions, and should not permit any free\\ninterpretation of the decisions it has adopted, much less\\npermit the use of its decisions by anyone for selfish\\npolitical or economic ends. It is necessary to take very\\nserious account of the humanitarian implications of\\nsanctions both for the population of the States subject to\\n14\\n\\n\\nsuch sanctions and for third countries. The punishment of\\nentire nations, especially for an indefinite time and\\nindiscriminately, is inadmissible.\\nPeacemaking is one of the key areas of United Nations\\nactivities. During the past 50 years the Organization has\\nacquired vast practical experience in this field. Having\\nsuccessfully survived intense disputes and ideological\\nbattles, peacemaking has proved its vital power and\\nimportance for securing world and regional stability. The\\nevolution of the theory and practice of present-day\\npeacemaking confirms that there is no alternative to\\nmaintaining the central role of the United Nations in this\\nsphere. The encouragement of peacemaking and the\\nstrengthening of its legal basis in strict conformity with the\\nfundamental principles of the Charter should become an\\nimportant component of the concept of the world in the\\ntwenty-first century. Building up and modernizing the anti-\\ncrisis capability of the United Nations is a key prerequisite\\nfor tackling these tasks successfully. The top priority here\\nis to begin truly using the system of stand-by agreements\\nwith the United Nations.\\nTaking into account the limited resources of the world\\nOrganization, and given the high demand for peacekeeping\\noperations, cooperation and division of labour between the\\nUnited Nations and regional structures has become a\\npriority. It is of fundamental importance that such\\ncooperation should be in strict accordance with Chapter\\nVIII of the Charter and should be fully consistent with the\\nprerogatives of the Security Council.\\nFor Russia, the question of peacemaking cooperation\\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations is\\nfar from theoretical. For many years, Russian peacemakers\\nwithin the peacekeeping forces of the Commonwealth of\\nIndependent States (CIS) have contributed to stabilizing the\\nsituations in Abkhazia, Georgia, in Tajikistan, and in Trans-\\nDniestria, Moldova. This testifies to the fact that the\\nsettlement of conflicts within the framework of the CIS is\\na priority for Russia. As before, we do not see any\\nreasonable alternative to political settlement of these crisis\\nsituations, for which political will, patience and\\ncommitment to one’s obligations are needed. We consider\\nit important for the United Nations to continue to play a\\nprominent role in finding solutions in Tajikistan and in\\nAbkhazia, Georgia.\\nThe Organization for Security and Cooperation in\\nEurope (OSCE), which is called upon to play a central role\\nin ensuring European security and stability, can and should\\nbe the main United Nations peacemaking partner in Europe.\\nWhen this arrangement fails to work, not only do specific\\nEuropean countries suffer, but providing for global and\\ncontinental security becomes complicated. In a broad\\nsense, OSCE peacemaking parameters, ranging from\\nconflict prevention to peacekeeping operations and post-\\nconflict rehabilitation, should be defined in a charter on\\nEuropean security. Russia proposes too that the charter\\nshould also reflect such principles important for the future\\nof Europeans as ensuring the security and the foundations\\nof the relations between European and Euro-Atlantic\\norganizations in this area. Then the charter will indeed\\nbecome a kind of political constitution for the Europe of\\nthe twenty-first century. As the Istanbul summit of the\\nOSCE, which is expected to adopt the charter, is\\napproaching fast, we should press ahead with the\\nformulation of a substantive document.\\nThe Conference on Interaction and Confidence-\\nbuilding Measures in Asia may become an important\\nfactor for stability on the Asian continent after the new\\npositive impetus it received at the recent Almaty Foreign\\nAffairs Ministers’ Meeting of the founding States. The\\nAssociation of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN)\\nRegional Forum, a venue for active dialogue on a broad\\nspectrum of urgent international issues, is yet another\\nexample of the focus of the Asian countries on the\\nformation of solid structures for security and cooperation\\non the continent.\\nIt is necessary to enhance the potential of African\\nregional and subregional organizations, which are acting\\nin close cooperation with the United Nations to curb and\\ncope with conflicts and humanitarian catastrophes\\nemerging in Africa. It is the duty of the international\\ncommunity to render every possible support to the\\nAfrican peoples.\\nWhile strengthening the legal and practical basis of\\npeacemaking activities, special attention should be paid to\\nwhat is commonly called the human rights dimension.\\nThis relates not only to measures to minimize human\\nsufferings caused by armed conflicts, but also to efforts\\naimed at preventing humanitarian crises.\\nIn this connection, I cannot fail to mention the\\nunacceptable situation of countless thousands of people in\\nthe centre of Europe who, due to arbitrary actions by\\nauthorities, have found themselves deprived of their\\ncitizenship and of the right to use their native language\\nand enjoy full rights in their State of residence. Civilized\\nintegration, rather than latent assimilation — this is the\\nway out of the prevailing humanitarian situation in these\\n15\\n\\n\\ncountries. We welcome the efforts of the Organization for\\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Council\\nof Europe and the Council of Baltic Sea States (CBSS)\\naimed at eliminating violations of human rights and\\nfreedoms of the non-indigenous population of Latvia and\\nEstonia. We hope that the United Nations High\\nCommissioner for Human Rights will make her contribution\\nto these efforts.\\nThe risk of losing positive dynamics in the sphere of\\ndisarmament as a result of attempts to rely on unilateral\\npower methods cannot but cause concern. If the political\\nand legal fabric regulating international relations continues\\nto disintegrate further, then trends to ensure national\\nsecurity through an arms race will become even stronger.\\nRussia has consistently advocated the reduction and\\nlimitation of nuclear arsenals and strict compliance with the\\nnon-proliferation regime. For without this, ensuring\\nstrategic stability would prove impossible.\\nWe realize the importance of early ratification of the\\nSTART II Treaty and of the initiation of START III\\nnegotiations, under which Russia would be prepared, on a\\nreciprocal basis, to agree to considerable further reduction\\nof strategic offensive armaments. Naturally, this process\\nwill be feasible only if the existing agreements in this field,\\nfirst of all the ABM Treaty, are strictly observed. We\\nbelieve that the General Assembly should come out clearly\\nin support of the preservation and observance of the ABM\\nTreaty, which is a cornerstone of strategic stability, because\\nunilateral actions aimed at undermining the time-tested\\nregime established by this Treaty are fraught with\\nextremely dangerous consequences. A collective search for\\npolitical and diplomatic solutions is the alternative to\\nmilitary responses to the problems of proliferation. This is\\nprecisely the target of Russia’s initiative concerning the\\nglobal system of control over proliferation of missiles and\\nmissile technologies.\\nSubstantive discussions on threats to international\\ninformation security must also be continued within the\\nframework and under the auspices of the United Nations.\\nThe time has come to reach, through joint efforts, a\\ncommon understanding of such threats and of measures to\\nreduce them.\\nThe twentieth century has brought about economic\\nglobalization. All economies have become open and closely\\nlinked as a result of advances in science and technology.\\nAll these factors have provided a powerful impetus to\\nsocial and economic development while creating their own\\nspecific problems. The gap between the industrial and the\\nformerly colonial worlds has not only persisted but has\\nbegun to widen. Development assistance should remain a\\nprincipal focus of future United Nations activities. Crises,\\nprimarily financial ones, have assumed an international\\ncharacter. We must draw the appropriate lessons and\\nmodernize the architecture of the world financial system.\\nThe United Nations and its specialized agencies should\\nplay a role here.\\nThe expansion of human economic activities has\\nbrought about a globalization of both natural and\\nman-made disasters, and this has become a major\\ndestabilizing global factor. The challenges related to the\\nprevention of such disasters and the elimination of their\\nconsequences require that the most advanced technologies\\nbe used for the benefit of the world community as a\\nwhole. Why not consider, therefore, the establishment,\\nunder the auspices of the United Nations, of a specialized\\ninternational emergency agency which would assume\\nrelevant functions?\\nA widely known saying reads: \"It is much easier to\\nwin a war than a peace.\" The United Nations founders\\nwon the war and laid the foundations for peace. It is our\\nduty to win this peace and to make it comprehensive and\\nirreversible.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"The Millennium Summit has given all of us\\nthe priority task of establishing a new and equitable\\nworld order — an order which would meet the interests\\nof all and every member of the international\\ncommunity and ensure adequate solutions to the\\nproblems with which the twenty-first century is\\nconfronting us.\\nI am convinced that in this era of globalization\\nand enormous scientific and technological progress,\\nhumankind can and should have a comprehensive and\\nforward-looking strategy. While in the past century\\nhuman civilization's main task was that of survival,\\ntoday we are confronted with significantly more\\ndifficult problems which are much more varied in\\nterms of their scope and orientation.\\nThe strategy of survival must give way to a\\nstrategy of sustainable development aimed at ensuring\\nthe prosperity of humankind. It must be based on the\\nrecognition of the indivisibility of international\\nsecurity, the use of modern scientific and technological\\nachievements for the benefit of the entire international\\n6\\n\\ncommunity, and a gradual closing of the development\\ngap between the various States.\\nThese ambitious goals can be achieved only\\nthrough the preservation and strengthening of strategic\\nstability in its very broadest sense.\\nStrategic stability means further progress in the\\ndisarmament process, reliable prevention of the spread\\nof weapons of mass destruction. Today nuclear\\ndisarmament and non-proliferation are no longer the\\nsubject of exclusive interaction between Russia, the\\nUnited States and other nuclear Powers. What is\\nneeded is the effective involvement of multilateral\\nUnited Nations mechanisms and the entire world\\ncommunity in those processes.\\nThe outcome of the Millennium Summit provides\\nadditional opportunities for the achievement of a major\\nbreakthrough in disarmament in the twenty-first\\ncentury. This will require consistent joint efforts aimed\\nat strict compliance with the agreements already\\nconcluded; a step-by-step reduction and eventual\\nelimination of weapons of mass destruction under\\neffective international control, and the limitation of\\nother types of armaments; and prevention of the arms\\nrace in new spheres.\\nThe time has come to give a new impetus to the\\nwork of the Conference on Disarmament, which has\\nproved in practice the effectiveness of multilateral\\ndiplomacy under the auspices of the United Nations.\\nRussia advocates the resumption of substantive work at\\nthat forum on major issues on the disarmament agenda.\\nThe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\\nWeapons (NPT) provides an indispensable international\\nlegal basis for nuclear disarmament. This has once\\nagain been reaffirmed in full by the 2000 Review\\nConference. Russia will work to ensure that the\\ndecisions of the Millennium Assembly promote the\\npractical implementation of the agreements reached\\nduring that Conference. It is precisely for that purpose\\nthat the President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir\\nPutin, put forward an initiative on the development and\\nimplementation, under the auspices of the International\\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), of an international\\nproject designed to phase out the use of enriched\\nuranium and pure plutonium in the civilian nuclear\\nenergy sector.\\nWe are satisfied to note the increasing number of\\nStates acceding to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty\\n(CTBT). Its speedy entry into force is in the interests of\\nthe entire international community. Having ratified the\\nTreaty, we call on those that have yet not done so to\\nfollow suit.\\nWe expect that the United States will follow\\nRussia in completing ratification of the Treaty on the\\nFurther Reduction and Limitation of Strategic\\nOffensive Arms (START II), which will help make it\\noperational. We are ready to actively continue the\\nprocess of nuclear disarmament and to move towards\\nthe conclusion of a START III Treaty with an even\\nlower threshold of nuclear warheads — down to 1,500\\nunits. But this will be feasible only if the 1972 Anti-\\nBallistic Missile (ABM) Treaty remains intact. It is\\nuniversally acknowledged that this major Treaty\\nconcerns the vital security interests of the international\\ncommunity as a whole. Its preservation is a key\\nelement of global stability and a strong barrier to the\\narms race in regard to nuclear weapons, missiles and\\nother weapons of mass destruction.\\nRussia will be introducing a draft resolution in\\nsupport of the ABM Treaty. We hope that, as was the\\ncase last year, our initiative will receive broad support\\nwithin the United Nations.\\nA peaceful earth needs a peaceful outer space. At\\nthe Millennium Summit the President of Russia\\nproposed the convening in Moscow of an international\\nconference on the prevention of the weaponization of\\nouter space, to take place in the spring of 2001, when\\nthe fortieth anniversary of the first manned flight to\\nouter space is to be commemorated. We hope that this\\nproposal will be actively supported.\\nStrategic stability means reliable safeguarding of\\ninternational information security and counteracting\\nthe use of scientific and technological achievements for\\npurposes incompatible with universal progress and the\\nmaintenance of international peace. Aware of the great\\nimportance of resolving these most urgent issues,\\nRussia will introduce for consideration by the General\\nAssembly a draft resolution entitled “Developments in\\nthe field of informatization and telecommunications in\\nthe context of international information security”.\\nStrategic stability also means enhancing peace\\nand security on all continents, settling existing regional\\nconflicts and preventing new ones and cutting off\\nexternal support for them. Millions of people must be\\nspared the death and suffering caused by local crises.\\n7\\n\\nHow can this goal be achieved? It is only through\\nthe joint efforts of all States collectively responsible\\nfor the world's destiny. Experience has shown that\\nunilateral enforcement actions cannot guarantee a\\nlasting and fair settlement of crisis situations.\\nThe notions of sovereignty and the territorial\\nintegrity of States are still very much alive. Disregard\\nfor these principles and military intervention\\ncircumventing the Security Council, whatever\\nhumanitarian pretexts may be used, undermine the very\\nfoundations of the world order and pave the way for\\narbitrariness in international affairs.\\nThe prevention and settlement of crises should\\nbecome a key element of international security in the\\ntwenty-first century. When there is collective\\ndetermination and goodwill, even the most complex\\nand major problems lend themselves to a political\\nresolution.\\nAll of this calls for improvement of the\\npeacekeeping potential of our Organization. People in\\n“hotbeds” of the planet — from Africa and Lebanon to\\nEast Timor — rightly associate with the United Nations\\n“Blue Helmets” their hopes for an end to bloody\\nconflicts and for the beginning of complex\\nreconciliation processes. They expect rapid and\\neffective steps from us.\\nWe hope that the Millennium Assembly will\\nprovide us with an opportunity to engage in a\\ncomprehensive analysis of the work of United Nations\\npeacekeeping mechanisms and outline ways to increase\\ntheir efficiency. Such is the objective of the report\\n(A/55/305) prepared under the aegis of the Secretary-\\nGeneral by the Brahimi Panel. It is important to\\nconsiderably enhance the United Nations capacity for\\nthe prompt deployment of peacekeeping operations.\\nThis can be done through the early completion of the\\nsystem of standby arrangements. Peacekeeping units of\\nthe United Nations Secretariat need to be strengthened,\\nwith provision for professional planning, control and\\ncommand of operations.\\nRussia consistently advocates the expansion of\\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional\\nstructures in the field of peacekeeping. Chapter VIII of\\nthe United Nations Charter remains the basis for such\\ninteraction. Any regional or “coalition” operation\\nshould be conducted under conditions of transparency\\nand of reporting to the United Nations Security\\nCouncil, whereas operations with enforcement\\nelements should be carried out only with the\\nauthorization of the Security Council.\\nThe Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)\\nis a major regional partner of the United Nations in\\npeacekeeping. In many respects, it was the close\\ncooperation between the United Nations and the CIS\\nthat made it possible to successfully resolve the\\nconflict in Tajikistan. Such interaction will\\nundoubtedly intensify along with the development of\\nthe CIS anti-crisis potential. At the same time, for a\\nstable peace to prevail in the conflict-affected regions\\nin the CIS area the volume of international economic\\nand humanitarian aid for their rehabilitation should be\\nincreased.\\nRussia attaches primary importance to the\\nexpansion of cooperation between the United Nations\\nand regional and subregional mechanisms in Africa to\\nprovide for more effective crisis response on the\\ncontinent. This is evidenced by the Russian\\nparticipation in peacekeeping operations in a number of\\nAfrican countries.\\nThe entire experience of United Nations\\npeacekeeping activities in recent years clearly shows\\nthe priority of political and diplomatic methods of\\nconflict settlement. It is precisely these methods that\\nmake it possible to minimize the suffering of the\\ncivilian population and to find ways to a stable peace.\\nStrategic stability means the security and\\ntranquillity of civil society and of the individual. This\\ntask can be accomplished only through the combined\\nefforts of the international community to counter\\ncontemporary threats and challenges. These include,\\ninter alia, aggressive separatism and religious\\nextremism, illicit arms trafficking and organized crime.\\nSuch an abhorrent manifestation of extremism as\\ninternational terrorism poses a direct threat to security\\nand stability. Today, terrorists of every stripe\\nsometimes act in a more organized fashion than does\\nthe world community confronting them. We expect that\\nthe United Nations will step up its mobilization of\\ninternational capacities to counteract terrorism. Such\\ncooperation must be based on the clear principles set\\nforth in the Security Council resolution 1269 (1999):\\nno support whatsoever, no safe havens for terrorists,\\nthe inevitability of punishment for every terrorist act.\\nAs to those who violate these principles the Security\\nCouncil must be ready to take measures against them\\nprovided for in the United Nations Charter.\\n8\\n\\nRussia intends to ratify the Convention for the\\nSuppression of Terrorist Financing elaborated under\\nUnited Nations auspices. There is an urgent need to\\ncomplete work on the convention for the suppression of\\nacts of nuclear terrorism, and that work on a\\ncomprehensive anti-terrorism convention should be\\nstepped up.\\nTerrorism is often closely linked with drug\\ntrafficking and organized crime. We welcome the\\ncompletion of the development of an international\\nconvention against organized crime. Russia intends to\\nsign it in the nearest future. We also support the\\nproposal on drafting an international convention on the\\nfight against corruption.\\nStrategic stability means promoting human rights\\nand freedoms everywhere. This area is an important\\ncomponent of the United Nations activities aimed at\\nestablishing a new world order based on international\\nlaw.\\nRussia contributes significantly to strengthening\\nthe universal legal regime. Our country has signed the\\nStatute of the International Criminal Court.\\nSpeaking of pooling the efforts of States to\\nresolve the twofold task of maintaining international\\nsecurity and ensuring human security, human rights and\\nfreedoms, we should constantly bear in mind that in the\\ntwentieth century the rule of the ideology of racial\\nhatred cost mankind scores of millions of human lives.\\nUnfortunately, today, 55 years after the great victory it\\nis still premature to speak of total eradication of the\\nbacillus of national superiority.\\nWe cannot accept a situation in which people do\\nnot have the right to use their mother tongue, are\\ndeprived of their citizenship and jobs on ethnic\\ngrounds, when fighters against fascism are put behind\\nbars while former fascists find favour with the\\nauthorities. The Organization for Security and\\nCooperation in Europe, the Council of Europe and the\\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights\\nshould firmly respond to all such manifestations.\\nStrategic stability must be based on a solid\\nmaterial foundation. The twenty-first century will go\\ndown in history as the century of mankind's\\nbreakthrough to a qualitatively new level of\\ndevelopment only if we manage to preserve peace and\\ninternational security and at the same time impart\\nnecessary dynamism and depth to the process of\\neconomic and technological equalization between the\\nenormous number of developing countries and the\\ncomparatively small group of leading countries. This\\ngoal cannot be achieved overnight. This will require —\\nunder the unifying and guiding hand of the United\\nNations — a mechanism for collective democratic\\nmanagement of the international monetary, trade and\\neconomic systems. They must become more rational\\nand fair and be targeted against poverty and\\nunderdevelopment.\\nIt is important to make the most of those\\nopportunities which have been opened up by the new\\ntechnological revolution in order to initiate the process\\nof bridging the gap in the levels of development.\\nInformation and communications technologies whose\\npotential for speeding up global development is only\\ncomparable to the invention of written language can\\nserve as a driving force of that process. A chance has\\nemerged to skip over several traditional stages of\\ndevelopment through the introduction of global\\ncomputer literacy and information technologies.\\nMankind, equipped with this powerful instrument, will\\nobtain a real opportunity to begin creating conditions\\nfor a decent life and the all-around development of\\nhuman beings everywhere on earth.\\nStrategic stability means the preservation of a\\nclean and healthy environment for the present and\\nfuture generations. The United Nations has done a\\ngreat deal to mobilize international efforts in that\\nimportant field. The “Rio+10” Forum, to be held in\\n2002, will provide an opportunity not only to sum up\\nthe results of those activities but also to outline a\\nfuture-oriented follow-up programme.\\nRussia supports the expansion of international\\ncooperation within the United Nations framework in\\nthe areas of biodiversity, climate, combating\\ndesertification, as well as of forest preservation.\\nThe recent increase over the last few years in the\\nnumber of natural and man-made disasters and the\\nconsequent growth of the scope of human and material\\nlosses have made disaster management one of the most\\nformidable global challenges facing mankind. While\\nintensifying the United Nations efforts to promote\\ninternational cooperation in this field, special attention\\nmust be paid to the use of state-of-the-art specialized\\ntechnologies for disaster management and to the search\\nfor innovative mechanisms for their use in the interests\\nof the entire international community.\\n9\\n\\nThe United Nations — a unique universal forum\\nin every respect, which has demonstrated in practice its\\ncentral role in managing international affairs — should\\nbecome a guarantor of such comprehensive strategic\\nstability. Russia welcomes the consensus reached at the\\nMillennium Summit on consolidating the United\\nNations as the axis of the present world order. The time\\nhas come for concrete collective measures to transform\\nthe Organization into a sort of operational headquarters\\nfor coordinating activities aimed at ensuring a new\\nstrategic stability based on the principles of\\nmultilateralism, equality and solidarity in resolving\\nglobal problems.\\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize once\\nagain that the Russian Federation, for its part, is open\\nto the closest interaction with all members of the\\ninternational community in order to make strategic\\nstability a cornerstone of the world order in the twenty-\\nfirst century and the United Nations its reliable\\nguarantor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n",
       " 'Traditionally, the General Assembly session \\nprovides an opportunity to conduct a review of the \\ncurrent situation in the world, identify major \\ninternational issues and determine the role that the \\nUnited Nations could play in resolving them.  \\n I believe that we have every reason to conclude \\nthat there is a prevailing trend of growing awareness of \\nthe need to strengthen the collective foundations of \\ninternational politics, as well as of the fact that there is \\nno alternative to tackling problems through multilateral \\ndiplomacy. That trend is based on objective facts, for it \\nreflects the realities of an emerging multipolar \\narchitecture of international relations. It is logical, \\nbecause answers to global challenges and threats can \\nonly be found collectively. Finally, it is a manifestation \\nof historical continuity, because we are revisiting the \\nsame objective as the founding fathers of the United \\nNations were determined to pursue by enshrining in the \\nCharter the principles for a system of collective \\nsecurity.  \\n It is precisely such an approach, firmly grounded \\nin international law, that can ensure the world’s \\nsustainable development in this era of globalization. \\nThat requires a strengthened central role for the \\nuniversal Organization in every area of international \\nlife. \\n We must of course continue to adapt the \\nmechanisms and methods of the United Nations to the \\nnew environment. Much has been done as follow-up to \\nthe decisions of the 2005 World Summit: The \\nPeacebuilding Commission and the Human Rights \\nCouncil have been established, and the reform process \\nhas been extended to management.  \\n It is important that all our further work be based \\nupon the fundamental principle of the universality of \\nthe United Nations. Patterns contrary to the Charter of \\nthe United Nations that exclude individual States or \\ngroups of States from participating meaningfully in the \\nactivities of the Organization or that introduce a single \\nsystem of values into the work of the Secretariat are \\nunsustainable. Let us not forget that the United Nations \\nbelongs to us all. Moreover, administrative reform \\nshould not lead to the bureaucracy taking over the \\nmanagement of the Organization, thereby jeopardizing \\nthe intergovernmental nature of the United Nations. \\n A trend towards collective action has also spread \\nbeyond the structures of the United Nations. During \\nRussia’s presidency of the Group of Eight (G-8), there \\nwas greater interaction between the G-8 and other \\nleading countries and international organizations. Over \\n  \\n \\n06-53005 28 \\n \\nthe past 12 months our dialogue partners have actively \\ncontributed to Saint Petersburg summit documents on \\nevery main agenda item, including global energy \\nsecurity, education and controlling infectious diseases.  \\n A new and genuinely collaborative type of \\ninteraction between the G-8 and Africa is now \\nemerging in this era of globalization, as the needs of \\nthe continent are reflected in the mainstream of world \\ndevelopment rather than being viewed as issues \\ndivorced from overall trends.  \\n The G-8 does not have a monopoly over the \\ndecisions taken at Saint Petersburg. All States are \\ninvited to participate in their implementation. \\n Regional organizations and cooperation and \\ncoordination between those organizations and the \\nUnited Nations have also strengthened in maintaining \\ninternational peace and security. Issues pertaining to \\nthat were discussed yesterday at the special ministerial \\nmeeting of the Security Council (see S/PV.5529). Once \\nagain, we are dealing here with an important dimension \\nof collective action by the international community. \\n The Commonwealth of Independent States has \\nmade a significant contribution to such interaction. To \\naddress common problems, specific actions have been \\ntaken within the Commonwealth area, primarily within \\nthe Eurasian Economic Community and the Collective \\nSecurity Treaty Organization. Further substantive and \\nresolute efforts are being made in the context of the \\nShanghai Cooperation Organization, which developed \\nand launched and initiative to establish a partnership \\nnetwork for multilateral organizations in the Asia-\\nPacific region. Development patterns in that region \\nwill largely determine the future contours of our planet.  \\n Multilateral institutions in Latin America have \\nalso become stronger, and the development of the \\nAfrican Union is gaining momentum. \\n At their recent Summit in Havana, heads of State \\nof the countries of the Non-Aligned Movement \\nexpressed their support for a collective search — \\nwithin the context of the central role of the United \\nNations — for agreed solutions to problems \\nconfronting the world community. \\n Europe, of course, is not outside the common \\ntrend towards collective examination and resolution of \\ncommon problems. In that connection, we also see \\ngrowing awareness of the fact that security and \\nprosperity are indivisible. We expect NATO to \\ntransform itself from a defence alliance into something \\nmore contemporary that would be in line with \\nprinciples of transparency and collective response and \\nbased upon a universal legal foundation.  \\n We have been watching with keen interest the \\nemerging foreign policy and security mechanisms of \\nthe European Union. Russia is prepared to cooperate \\nwith multilateral structures in the Euro-Atlantic space \\nand other regions of the world. In fact, we already have \\neffective common mechanisms with many of them. \\n Collective efforts are also needed to further \\ndevelop international law, primarily within the context \\nof countering new threats. The United Nations Global \\nCounter-terrorism Strategy (resolution 60/288), which \\nwas recently adopted by consensus, is an important \\ncontribution in terms of strengthening the legal basis \\nfor the anti-terrorist coalition and ensuring a \\ncomprehensive approach to counter-terrorism. It is not \\nonly about countering all terrorist manifestations and \\nideologies, it is also about eliminating the problems \\nthat give rise to terrorism. The next step will be to \\nagree upon a comprehensive anti-terrorism convention. \\n It is necessary to secure the achievements that \\nhave been made by taking practical steps. In the course \\nof Russia’s presidency of the G-8, the Second \\nMinisterial Conference on Drug Trafficking Routes \\nFrom Afghanistan was held, where additional measures \\nwere approved aimed at mobilizing the international \\ncommunity to counter the terrorism-related drug threat \\noriginating from Afghanistan. Another international \\nmeeting will be held in Moscow next November to \\nfocus on developing modalities for government-\\nbusiness partnerships in countering terrorism. \\n What is needed today are more proactive \\nmeasures to prevent lethal weapons from falling into \\nthe hands of non-State actors, as well as the consistent \\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 1540 \\n(2004) and other counter-terrorism resolutions of the \\nCouncil. The Russia-United States global initiative to \\ncombat nuclear terrorism, which was launched at Saint \\nPetersburg by Presidents Vladimir V. Putin and George \\nW. Bush last July, should be an important tool in \\npreventing a linkage between weapons of mass \\ndestruction and terrorism. That initiative invites \\ninterested States to act collectively. \\n The ever-growing demand for the unique \\npeacekeeping capabilities of the United Nations also \\ncalls for a collective effort. Not all of those capabilities \\n \\n \\n29 06-53005 \\n \\nhave been utilized to the fullest. Utilizing the \\ncapabilities of the Military Staff Committee, as well as \\nthose of regional organizations, on the basis of the \\nrelevant provisions of the United Nations Charter \\nwould be helpful. \\n It is encouraging to see a more active role being \\nplayed by Africans themselves in peacemaking \\noperations in Africa — an undertaking spearheaded by \\nthe African Union and supported by the United \\nNations.  \\n In a number of crisis situations conditions are \\ngradually emerging for a transition to post-conflict \\nreconstruction. It is our hope that the Declaration on \\nCooperation and Future Action in Stabilization and \\nReconstruction adopted at the Saint Petersburg G-8 \\nSummit will help us complement the efforts of the \\nUnited Nations and regional organizations at this \\ncritically important period of transition to \\npeacebuilding. \\n A comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli \\nconflict remains a central task for the world \\ncommunity. Many of today’s threats have come \\ntogether in that region, and the key to resolving them is \\nmost often to be found there. In that connection, I \\nshould first like to mention the truly global challenge \\nposed by the need to prevent a schism between \\ncivilizations.  \\n We welcome the emerging prospects for a \\nnational agreement in the Palestinian territories, as \\nwell as for the resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli \\ntalks. It is important to continue to encourage the \\nparties to meet their respective obligations, with the \\nclear understanding that any progress towards the \\nobjectives set out by the international community will \\ninevitably be gradual and that any attempt to act in an \\nall-or-nothing spirit will be counterproductive and \\ncould once again plunge the region into confrontation. \\n The recent war in Lebanon demonstrated the \\ngreat fragility of the situation in the Middle East and \\nthe acute need for a comprehensive approach along all \\ntracks. That presupposes the involvement of all \\ncountries and parties. Without their participation it will \\nbe impossible to reach any viable negotiated solution. \\nIt is also clear that the road to comprehensive peace \\nwill not be an easy one, but now is the time. The \\ninitiative of the League of Arab States to convene an \\ninternational conference should contribute to finding \\nthe proper framework for that undertaking. The Quartet \\nof international mediators should also make a key \\ncontribution to the process. \\n A breakthrough on a Middle East settlement \\ncould provide the positive momentum so wanting in \\nthe region. It could also facilitate the solution of other \\nburning problems in the region and in neighbouring \\ncountries. That is particularly true as regards efforts \\naimed at stabilizing the situation in Iraq, where \\nattempts to contain wanton violence and chaos have \\nthus far proved unsuccessful. Dozens of people, mainly \\ncivilians, continue to die in Iraq every day. Five \\nofficials of the Russian embassy in Baghdad have also \\nfallen victim to that barbarous massacre. A resolution \\nin Iraq will be possible only through concerted efforts. \\nThat requires the involvement in the political process \\nof all major Iraqi interests and the implementation of \\nthe plans of that country’s Government to reach \\ngenuine national accord, with the concerted support of \\nthe international community, including all of Iraq’s \\nneighbours. \\n We are, unfortunately, now witnessing growing \\nsignificance of the use of force in world affairs; that \\nundermines non-proliferation regimes. The feeling of a \\nlack of predictability and stability in the area of \\nsecurity is becoming ever more pronounced. Against \\nthat background, the growing interest of many States in \\nnuclear energy may give rise to concerns, given the \\ntrend towards the global proliferation of sensitive \\ntechnologies.  \\n Apart from current resolute steps to find \\nnegotiated solutions to individual problems — such as \\nthe Iranian nuclear programme and the problem of the \\nKorean peninsula — there is a need for an urgent effort \\nby the entire international community to systematically \\nstrengthen non-proliferation regimes on a generally \\nacceptable basis, while ensuring that the benefits of \\npeaceful atomic energy are legitimately accessible to \\nall States.  \\n President Vladimir V. Putin’s initiative to \\nestablish multilateral centres for nuclear fuel-cycle \\nservices, along with similar ideas proposed by the \\nleadership of the International Atomic Energy Agency \\n(IAEA) and proposals put forth by United States \\nPresident George W. Bush, have found support among \\nG-8 leaders. We are confident that the development and \\npractical implementation of such approaches — in \\ncooperation with all countries with an interest in \\nmodern and safe nuclear energy — will make it \\n  \\n \\n06-53005 30 \\n \\npossible to resolve non-proliferation issues in a non-\\nconfrontational manner. \\n As in other areas, the obsession with sanctions — \\napplied without calculating their consequences — \\nmight produce unpredictable results. It is absolutely \\nnecessary to eliminate the loopholes in the non-\\nproliferation regimes, but that should be done through \\nclear and non-discriminatory approaches, without \\ncreating grounds for suspicion regarding the existence \\nof some hidden agenda. \\n Stagnation in the international disarmament \\nprocess does not help to resolve non-proliferation \\nproblems. Here again, we need concerted action, for \\nthis is a matter of collective security. \\n In the area of strategic arms, the United States-\\nRussian agreements play an enormously important role. \\nTheir significance goes far beyond the framework of \\nbilateral relations, considering that virtually all \\nmembers of the international community benefit from \\nstrategic stability. We support the consistent \\ndevelopment of the United States-Russian bilateral \\ndisarmament process, as was stated by our Presidents \\nin Saint Petersburg in July.  \\n Closely related to that are issues related to anti-\\nballistic missiles, in particular within the context of the \\nexisting plans of the United States. In that context, \\nthere is a need for complete transparency and for an \\nanalysis of the consequences for strategic stability. \\n The situation surrounding the Treaty on \\nConventional Armed Forces in Europe continues to \\ncause grave concern. The old Treaty, based on the \\nrealities of confrontation between military blocs, has \\nlost its relevance, while NATO is blocking the entry \\ninto force of the Agreement on its adaptation. \\n At the same time, reconfiguration of the military \\narchitecture on the European continent is under way. At \\nits heart is an expanding military alliance. Such virtual \\narms control becomes meaningless as it turns into a \\none-way street.  \\n It is also necessary to revitalize multilateral \\ndisarmament approaches. That agenda should include \\nthe entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-\\nTest-Ban Treaty, non-deployment of weapons in outer \\nspace, conclusion of a fissile material cut-off treaty and \\nensuring information security. Nuclear-weapon-free \\nzones play an important role, and we welcome the \\ncreation of such a zone in Central Asia. \\n The overall task is to reinvigorate the efforts of \\nthe international community in the area of disarmament \\nand arms control, within the framework of the \\nConference on Disarmament and other relevant United \\nNations bodies.  \\n The 2005 World Summit unanimously reaffirmed \\nthat peace, security and development are inseparable. \\nWith that in mind, we are prepared to engage in \\ncollective discussions and support further joint \\npragmatic steps with a view to improving the \\nefficiency of the social and economic activities of the \\nentire United Nations system. \\n The Russian Federation realizes its responsibility \\nas one of the fastest growing economies of the world, \\nand is devoting increasing attention to development \\nassistance. Thus far, Russia has written off or has \\nundertaken to write off $11.3 billion of the debt of \\nAfrican countries, including more than $2.2 billion \\nwithin the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt \\nInitiative. New steps are planned in that area. Russia \\nnow ranks third in absolute figures of debt relief and \\nfirst in terms of the ratio of debt relief to gross \\ndomestic product. We have also increased our \\ncontributions to other international development \\nassistance mechanisms, including through United \\nNations institutions and funds and the Bretton Woods \\ninstitutions. \\n Today, I cannot fail to express my sincere \\nappreciation and praise to the Secretary-General Kofi \\nAnnan. For many years, during the most difficult times \\nfor world politics, he has carried out his duties with \\ndignity. Thanks largely to the efforts of Kofi Annan \\nand to his ability to take the lead while remaining a \\nrealist in the face of severe challenges, we have \\nmanaged to make progress in strengthening the United \\nNations. \\n Today the United Nations is relevant as never \\nbefore. We do not have to create it anew. In the course \\nof reforming the United Nations in accordance with the \\ndictates of the time, it is incumbent upon us all to \\nreaffirm by action our commitment to the world \\nOrganization, which draws its strength from our trust \\nin it and in its unique legitimacy. Without the United \\nNations and its Charter to rely upon, it would prove \\nimpossible to ensure a more reliable and democratic \\nsystem of collective security that would respond to the \\ndictates of our time. ',\n",
       " 'I \\nwould like, on behalf of the Republic of Kazakhstan \\nand on my own behalf, to congratulate Secretary-\\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon on his re-election to his high and \\nresponsible office. I should also like to congratulate the \\nAmbassador of Qatar, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, \\non his election to the presidency of the General \\nAssembly at its sixty-sixth session. The Republic of \\nKazakhstan also congratulates the newest Member of \\nthe community of nations, the Republic of South \\nSudan, on gaining its independence. \\n This year, our country celebrates the twentieth \\nanniversary of its independence. During this entire \\ntime, Kazakhstan has faithfully complied with the \\nletter and spirit of the United Nations Charter. First, we \\nclosed the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site, the largest in \\nthe world, thereby becoming one of the world’s first \\nnew non-nuclear States. This represents an enormous \\ncontribution on the part of my country to global peace \\nand stability. \\n Secondly, we succeeded in convening the \\nConference on Interaction and Confidence-Building \\nMeasures in Asia (CICA), which I proposed 19 years \\nago in this forum. Today it includes participants from \\n29 countries, representing nearly half the world’s \\npopulation. Last year, Kazakhstan became the first \\ncountry from the Commonwealth of Independent States \\nto chair the Organization for Security and Cooperation \\nin Europe (OSCE), injecting new energy into every \\narea of its work. We also succeeded in holding an \\nOSCE summit in our capital, Astana, the first in \\n11 years. The adoption of the Astana Declaration has \\nhelped to strengthen the OSCE and its efforts to create \\na cooperative and indivisible security community \\nacross the Euro-Atlantic and Eurasian regions. \\nKazakhstan has also called for the establishment of a \\nsingle platform for cooperative Eurasian security by \\ncombining the capabilities of the OSCE and CICA over \\nthe long term. \\n This year, Kazakhstan assumed an important \\nduty, the chairmanship of the Organization of Islamic \\nCooperation (OIC). We have focused our chairmanship’s \\nefforts on strengthening international and regional \\nsecurity; continuing dialogue between the Islamic \\nworld and the West; combating Islamophobia; and \\nenhancing programmes promoting the non-proliferation \\nof weapons of mass destruction. The most recent test \\nfor the OIC was the humanitarian crisis in Somalia. In \\nthat regard, we succeeded in raising $350 million for \\nprogrammes designed to deliver food, medical supplies \\nand economic restoration to Somalia. \\n Thirdly, 140 ethnic groups and 40 religious \\ndenominations live in our society in peace and \\nharmony. Astana regularly hosts congresses of leaders \\nof world and traditional religions. We have offered to \\nhold such forums under the auspices of the United \\nNations, and they have stabilized the region. That \\nrepresents our contribution to the global dialogue on \\nconfidence-building in the world. \\n Fourthly, our country has demonstrated a \\ncommitment to the Millennium Development Goals. \\nFollowing the break-up of the Soviet Union, we have \\nbeen able to move to the forefront in terms of the pace \\nof reform and economic growth. In the past two \\ndecades, we have posted a 14-fold increase in per \\ncapita gross domestic product, from about $700 to \\nabout $10,000. \\n Fifthly, Kazakhstan has called for the adoption of \\na global energy and environment strategy and has put \\nforward an ambitious “green bridge” environmental \\ninitiative. We plan to bring these ideas to the United \\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development, to be \\nheld in Rio de Janeiro next year. \\n The world is entering one of the most critical \\nperiods in its history. Humanity has harnessed powerful \\nsources of energy but is powerless against the forces of \\nnature. Enclaves of poverty and destitution are \\nemerging, even in the wealthiest and better-off \\ncountries. It is becoming harder and harder to contain \\noutbreaks involving ethnic and religious intolerance, \\neven in societies with well-established traditions of \\ntolerance. \\n \\n \\n21 11-50692 \\n \\n In today’s inclusive information age, there are no \\nreliable means of protection against electronic \\nextremism. Ten years ago, the whole world came \\ntogether in the face of the terrible tragedy of 9/11. Yet \\nno conclusive lessons have been learned from it, and \\nthe resurgence of international terrorism is evident in \\nvarious parts of the world. These are the main \\nchallenges of the new century. \\n In that context, I would like to draw the attention \\nof participants in this political discussion to the \\nfollowing. \\n First, we have to address issues related to global \\nnuclear safety and security. We call for the start of the \\ndrafting of a universal declaration on a nuclear-\\nweapon-free world. We have high hopes for the \\nNuclear Security Summit, scheduled to be held in \\nSeoul in 2012. It is necessary to expand the legal \\nframework for, and increase international control by \\nthe United Nations and the International Atomic \\nEnergy Agency, compliance by all countries with their \\nobligations in the area of non-proliferation. \\n We welcome the Treaty between the United States \\nof America and the Russian Federation on Measures \\nfor the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic \\nOffensive Arms. We consider it important that all \\nStates that make up the Nuclear Club join that process. \\n Today the world faces a paradoxical situation: \\nsome are allowed to possess and upgrade nuclear \\nweapons, while others are strictly forbidden to be \\nengaged even in research and development. This is \\nunjust, disproportionate and unfair. The relevant \\nprovisions of international law must thus be reviewed. \\nThe idea is to strengthen the responsibility of all \\nStates, especially nuclear-weapon States, to reduce \\nnuclear weapons and gradually destroy their stockpiles. \\n Today there are no clear legal assurances to \\nnon-nuclear States by nuclear-weapon Powers. In this \\nimportant dimension, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \\nof Nuclear Weapons does not work. At this stage, \\nnuclear weapons are not a deterrent but a catalyst of an \\narms race. \\n In the twenty-first century, general curbs on the \\narms race can be effectively provided only by a \\ncollegial body with broad powers such as the Security \\nCouncil. I also propose that we issue a collective \\nappeal on the part of the international community to de \\nfacto nuclear-weapon States to renounce their \\nambitions and to accede to comprehensive treaties. \\n Secondly, the increasing globalization of \\neconomic processes requires a paradigm shift in the \\neconomic component of the work of the United \\nNations. The raison d’être of global mechanisms for \\ncurrency, trade and economic regulation should be the \\nforecasting of global crises and the elimination of their \\ncauses. \\n It is generally agreed today that the current global \\ncrisis was caused by deficiencies in the global financial \\nsystem. However, to date no significant steps to \\naddress its flaws have been taken. Procrastination in \\ntackling this issue will result in new and violent \\nmanifestations of the crisis and a surge of regional and \\nglobal instability. \\n It is important to establish an effective global \\neconomic governance mechanism, with clear powers \\nand lines of accountability involving all institutions \\nand actors, an effective global reserve currency and \\ntight control over speculative capital. In this context, a \\npact on global regulation would seem quite relevant. \\n The prevention of global hunger and the growing \\nscarcity of water are other important issues. \\n Thirdly, information space is a sphere that is as \\nimportant to the future of humanity as mineral \\nresources, air, the aquatic world and outer space. Yet \\ntoday not a single international convention or \\nmultilateral treaty governs information processes. Is \\nthat not the reason why, in practical terms, most hacker \\nattacks on banks, businesses, Government institutions, \\nthe military and even nuclear facilities have been able \\nto be carried out with impunity? \\n I consider it important to establish an \\ninternational legal framework for global information \\nspace. The resolution on nine elements of a global \\nculture of cybersecurity (resolution 57/239), adopted \\nby the General Assembly in 2002, could serve as a \\nbasis for such efforts. \\n Fourthly, the new world order is taking shape \\nagainst the backdrop of increasing conflicts. It is quite \\nsignificant that today the world’s total military \\nspending is growing twice as fast as it did during the \\ncold war — by 6 per cent a year, reaching $1.5 trillion. \\nIn this regard, my initiative to establish a United \\nNations peacekeeping fund, which I put forward for the \\nfirst time 19 years ago, has become even more \\n  \\n \\n11-50692 22 \\n \\nrelevant. This would involve each State Member of the \\nUnited Nations allotting 1 per cent of its military \\nbudget for that purpose. I urge the international \\ncommunity to consider this idea once again and take \\nthe required action. \\n Sixty-six years ago, the United Nations was \\nfounded as an organization based on the principle of \\nthe sovereign equality of all its Members. However, \\none cannot but notice how today the principle of \\nnational sovereignty and territorial integrity is being \\neroded. That could undermine trust between nations. \\nToday it is essential to upgrade the norms of \\ninternational law concerning the national sovereignty \\nof States and, taking into account new realities, clearly \\ndefine the bounds beyond which the involvement of the \\ninternational community in the settlement of internal \\nconflicts is warranted. \\n Global peace will be enhanced only if the United \\nNations works more closely with regional security \\narrangements. With respect to the Eurasian region, \\nthese are the Conference on Interaction and \\nConfidence-building Measures in Asia, the Shanghai \\nCooperation Organization and the Collective Security \\nTreaty Organization. It is important to ensure that the \\ncomposition and the work of the Security Council \\nadequately reflect the structure of the modern world. At \\nthe same time, the veto mechanism will guarantee that \\nthe decisions that are adopted are balanced and \\neffective. \\n Kazakhstan has announced its candidacy for a \\nnon-permanent seat in the Security Council for 2017-\\n2018. We count on the support of the international \\ncommunity in this respect. \\n The complex question of Palestine has been \\nactively discussed these days. Kazakhstan supports the \\ncreation of a Palestinian State. A difficult issue, \\nhowever, has been placed on the scales of history; \\nPresident Obama spoke about this. For the long-\\nsuffering Palestinian people, like the Israeli people, the \\nnegotiating process has been ongoing for more than \\n50 years. Without independence and their own State, \\nthe Palestinians will not be able to achieve sustainable \\npeace in the Middle East. \\n Each new era in the history of humanity gives \\nrise to formidable challenges. Today, the most \\nimportant task is to successfully navigate the complex \\nglobal transformations of the twenty-first century. \\nTrust and unity among all nations will be a pillar of an \\nequitable new world order. ',\n",
       " 'This year the session of the General \\nAssembly is opening at a time when international \\nrelations are in a state of turbulence. The Middle East \\nand North Africa have gone through a period of large-\\nscale changes, and the situation is volatile in certain \\nother parts of the world. We have not yet been able to \\nput the global economy back on the track of \\nprogressive sustainable development. The increasing \\nnumber of alarming factors has been accompanied by \\nan exacerbation of social, inter-ethnic and intercultural \\nconflicts as well as outbreaks of extremism. \\n Just as a ship caught in adverse weather \\nconditions needs a united crew and a compass to find \\nthe right course, the international community today \\nneeds in particular to deploy joint efforts to respond to \\ncommon challenges and set clear guidelines to \\nstrengthen global governance mechanisms. We are \\nconvinced that such guidelines should include, first and \\nforemost, the rule of international law; clear, strict and \\nresponsible reliance on the fundamental principles of \\nthe Charter of the United Nations; and the will to \\nimplement a positive unification agenda. \\n The United Nations remains a pillar of \\ninternational relations and equitable multilateral \\ncooperation in the interests of all States. It has a unique \\nlegitimacy and the necessary authority to respond \\nadequately to the variety of contemporary risks and \\nthreats. It is the United Nations that should continue to \\nprovide political, legal and moral leadership in dealing \\nwith global challenges, to establish equitable principles \\nand standards of interaction, to monitor their \\nimplementation and to render necessary assistance and \\nsupport for the States that need it. \\n Ten years ago on September 11, a horrible \\nterrorist attack was committed in this city. We are \\nconvinced that it is necessary to strengthen multilateral \\ncooperation in countering international terrorism on \\nboth the global and regional levels. However, the \\nadditional mechanisms to be created in this area should \\nbe incorporated in our common work within the United \\nNations, with due account taken of its central \\ncoordinating role in combating terrorism. \\n Wide international cooperation is needed to keep \\nthe situation in the global economic and financial \\nsystem under control. One can hardly deny the \\nimportance of the role that the Group of Twenty (G-20) \\nplays in the post-crisis recovery of the world economy. \\nToday, it is important to finalize the process of \\nreforming the global financial and economic \\narchitecture and to implement everything we have \\nagreed on, rather than to stop halfway. The efficiency \\nof these efforts will only grow if the G-20 strengthens \\nits dialogue with the United Nations and its specialized \\nagencies.  \\n A significant contribution to the reform of the \\nglobal economy and finance is being made by \\nBRICS — Brazil, Russia, India, China and South \\nAfrica — a global-scale association of five major, \\nrapidly growing economies that reflects the realities of \\nthe evolving multipolar world. BRICS does not aim at \\nconfrontation with anyone. Its goal is to enhance \\nproductive multilateral collaboration to address the \\nurgent problems of the contemporary world. \\n Sustainable development requires a reliable \\nsupply of energy resources for the global economy. \\nRussia has proposed drafting a convention on \\ninternational energy security that would cover all \\naspects of global energy cooperation, taking into \\naccount the balance of interests of all actors in the \\ninternational market. We call for the start of the \\npractical preparation of this document. \\n As in economics, the logic of joint consolidated \\nactions should prevail in matters of security and the \\nelimination of surplus weapons worldwide. Russia and \\nthe United States made another important step towards \\nnuclear disarmament when they signed the Treaty on \\nStrategic Offensive Arms and began its \\nimplementation. Its practical realization will allow us \\nto make sure that the Treaty is effective and viable and \\n  \\n \\n11-51670 16 \\n \\nto see how its fundamental principles are implemented. \\nWe call on all States with nuclear weapons capability \\nto join the Russian-American efforts. We believe that \\nfurther progress in nuclear arms reductions is possible \\nonly on a multilateral basis. \\n Moreover, progress in this area is inseparable \\nfrom coordinated efforts to move forward on all \\naspects of strengthening international security and \\nstrategic stability. This includes development of \\nuniversally acceptable approaches to missile defence \\nissues, an accounting on the impact of strategic \\nconventional arms, prevention of the weaponization of \\nspace and elimination of qualitative and quantitative \\nimbalances in conventional arms. \\n The deployment of strategic missile defence \\nelements in various parts of the world alters the overall \\nconfiguration of international security. It is not enough \\nto make statements that the increase in global missile \\ndefence capabilities would not undermine the basics of \\nstrategic stability. The issue is far too serious. We need \\nsolid legal guarantees that missile defence potential \\nwill actually be adequate to the declared objectives and \\nwill not disrupt global and regional balances. This \\nholds equally true for both Europe and the Asia-Pacific \\nregion, where the missile defence factor is beginning to \\naffect the strategic environment. \\n It is of primary importance for us to prevent the \\nundermining of the non-proliferation regime. We call \\nfor universalization of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \\nof Nuclear Weapons, strengthening of the International \\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards system and \\nthe entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-\\nTest-Ban Treaty. Russia has been one of the main \\ninitiators of the proposal to convene in 2012 a \\nconference on establishing a zone free of weapons of \\nmass destruction and their means of delivery in the \\nMiddle East and is now working intensively, together \\nwith its partners, on the preparations for this important \\nforum. \\n The early resolution of the nuclear problems of \\nIran and the Korean Peninsula would contribute to the \\nstrengthening of the non-proliferation regime. We see \\nno alternative to their political and diplomatic \\nsettlement and to taking concrete steps to create the \\nconditions for the resumption of negotiations. We call \\non all partners to address these tasks with utmost \\nresponsibility. \\n The situation around Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi-1 \\nnuclear power plant has highlighted the need to \\nimprove the international legal framework in order to \\nensure the safety of nuclear power facilities. The \\nRussian Federation has made proposals to enhance the \\nmechanisms of the Convention on Nuclear Safety and \\nthe Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear \\nAccident and to strengthen the relevant IAEA norms. \\nWe urge support for these initiatives. \\n In the age of new telecommunications \\ntechnologies, international information security has \\nbecome a challenge that requires coordinated efforts by \\nthe international community. Reliable protection of the \\nfield of information from malicious and criminal \\nattacks is the goal of the initiative that Russia and its \\npartners are promoting at the United Nations. During \\nthis session, we will put forward proposals on \\ndeveloping specific rules of conduct in this area. \\n In a polycentric world, an effective international \\narchitecture can be created only if it rests on regional \\nbuilding blocks. The enhancing of global governance at \\nthe regional level and the increasing role of regional \\norganizations are an integral part of modern \\ninternational relations. Integration associations and \\norganizations in the Commonwealth of Independent \\nStates area contribute to these processes. The Eurasian \\nEconomic Community, with its $10 billion anti-crisis \\nfund, operates in the financial and economic sphere. A \\ncustoms union between Russia, Kazakhstan and \\nBelarus has been created, and single economic space is \\ntaking shape with a view to establishing a Eurasian \\nunion. \\n The Collective Security Treaty Organization \\n(CSTO) is a key tool for ensuring stability within the \\narea of its responsibility. The signing of the joint \\ndeclaration on cooperation between the United Nations \\nSecretariat and the CSTO secretariat in March 2011 \\nwas a major step in the collaboration between these \\ntwo organizations, primarily in the field of \\npeacekeeping. We are ready to start working on its \\npractical modalities. Russia consistently calls for \\ninteraction between regional organizations, under the \\nauspices of the United Nations, to strengthen global \\nstability on the basis of the solid legal framework of \\nthe Charter. \\n Priority should be given to equal and indivisible \\nsecurity, predictability, transparency and mutual \\nrespect, taking into account one other’s interests. This \\n \\n \\n17 11-51670 \\n \\nis exactly the aim of Russian President Medvedev’s \\ninitiative to sign a treaty on European security. Its \\npractical implementation would allow us to finally put \\na period to the post-cold war era, to establish a \\nuniversal and clear framework for a reliable solution to \\nsuch issues as missile defence and arms control, and to \\ncreate a common space of security and development \\nwithout dividing lines. \\n Achieving equal and indivisible security is an \\nurgent issue for the Asia-Pacific region, with the \\nRussian Far East and Eastern Siberia as integral parts. \\nThe joint initiative launched by the leaders of China \\nand Russia in September 2010 is aimed at creating a \\ncomprehensive architecture for security and \\ncooperation in the Asia-Pacific region on a bloc-free \\nlegal basis. We could move closer to this goal by \\npromoting a network of multilateral diplomacy, an idea \\nthat has been supported by the members of the \\nShanghai Cooperation Organization. \\n Progress in the settlement of regional conflicts \\nwould contribute to a more stable international \\nenvironment. Today, special attention is given to the \\ndevelopments in the Arab world.  \\n Russia condemns the use of violence against \\ncivilians and supports the aspirations of Arab peoples \\nfor the revival of their States and their democratic \\ndevelopment and social and economic prosperity. At \\nthe same time, actions by the outside forces must be \\nbased on full respect for international law and be \\ninstrumental to the search for a political settlement \\nbetween the authorities and the opposition. The \\nattempts to go beyond the Security Council mandate \\nare unacceptable, since they undermine its authority \\nand compound the suffering of innocent civilians. \\n In this context, it seems quite pertinent that States \\nand regional organizations commit themselves to \\nstrictly complying with the existing norms of \\ninternational law, including humanitarian law, in order \\nto protect civilians during armed conflict. This step, \\nwhich further enhances the existing legal basis of \\ninternational relations, would contribute to the \\nstrengthening of regional and global security in its \\nmodern, multidimensional interpretation. \\n The leading role in elaborating modalities for \\npost-conflict resolution in Libya must be played by the \\nUnited Nations and in particular the Security Council. \\nThat is precisely the goal of Security Council \\nresolution 2009 (2011) of 16 September 2011, which \\nestablished the United Nations Support Mission in \\nLibya. We believe that it is time to take additional \\nsteps, including the lifting of the no-fly zone. \\n As for Syria, it is inadmissible to boycott \\nproposals for a national dialogue, stir up confrontation \\nand provoke violence, while neglecting the reforms — \\nlate in coming, but still achievable — proposed by \\nPresident Al-Assad. It is important to encourage the \\nauthorities and the opposition to start negotiations and \\nagree on the future of their country. We hope that the \\nLeague of Arab States will make the necessary efforts. \\n The situation in the Middle East could be \\nsignificantly improved by progress in the negotiation \\nprocess, on the basis of the main parameters defined \\nand recorded in Security Council resolutions, the \\nMadrid terms of reference and the Arab Peace \\nInitiative, and reiterated in the Quartet ministerial \\nstatement of 23 September. The only viable basis for a \\nsettlement is the coexistence of Palestinian and Israeli \\nStates in peace and security. We support the \\nPalestinians’ application to the Security Council and \\nwelcome the readiness reiterated by the President of \\nthe Palestinian National Authority, Mr. Abbas, to hold \\ntalks with Israel on the basis of the existing \\ninternational legal framework. \\n We encourage the Cypriot communities to \\ncontinue negotiations under United Nations auspices to \\nachieve a comprehensive, just and viable settlement on \\nthe basis of the relevant Security Council resolutions. \\n We call upon all parties to the Nagorno-Karabakh \\nsettlement process to take advantage of the additional \\nopportunities arising from the efforts made in the \\ncontext of Russia’s mediation. We will promote \\nconfidence-building and ceasefire enforcement \\nmeasures within the framework of the Troika of the \\nco-Chairs of the Organization for Security and \\nCooperation in Europe Minsk Group, together with \\nAmerican and French partners. \\n We hope that the decision taken in Moscow on \\n22 September on resuming official talks on a \\nTransdniestrian settlement will encourage the parties to \\nseek ways to arrive at mutually acceptable agreements. \\n We are strongly committed to doing our utmost to \\nprevent a repetition of a scenario involving the use of \\nforce in the Caucasus, as happened in August 2008 as a \\nresult of a reckless venture by the ruling regime in \\nTbilisi. Russia is ready to act as a guarantor of \\n  \\n \\n11-51670 18 \\n \\narrangements on the non-use of force between \\nAbkhazia, Georgia, and South Ossetia, taking into \\naccount the earlier relevant statements made by the \\nleaders of these three parties. We would welcome it if \\nthe United States and the European Union made similar \\ncommitments. As guarantors, we would be ready to \\ntake steps to prevent the resumption of violence in the \\nregion and, in the case of the wrongful use of force by \\neither side, to work towards an early resolution of the \\nsituation on the basis of the existing norms of \\ninternational law. \\n Russia is providing significant support for the \\nefforts to stabilize the situation in Afghanistan. At the \\nsame time, we call on the International Security \\nAssistance Force to more effectively fight the growing \\nAfghan drug threat. Central Asia and Russia are \\nalready facing a “heroin aggression”, while the profits \\nfrom drug trafficking are being used as the main source \\nof financing the clandestine extremist underground in \\nthe region. The fight against this evil should be \\nuncompromising, and it should target the entire drug \\nbusiness chain. \\n The problems on the African continent should be \\na focus of continuous attention on the part of the \\nUnited Nations. Such attention should include \\ndevelopment assistance as well as efforts to overcome \\nthe current humanitarian crisis in the Horn of Africa \\nand resolve the numerous ongoing conflicts, while \\nmaintaining the leading role of the African Union. \\n The eradication of piracy remains a priority. It is \\nnecessary to accelerate the establishment of an \\ninternational anti-piracy court mechanism in the \\nregion, in accordance with the Security Council \\nresolution adopted on the initiative of Russia. \\n Experience has shown that pressure and unilateral \\nsanctions cannot be a cure-all in addressing various \\nconflict situations; they only complicate efforts to \\nresolve them. We urge that an end be put to any actions \\nthat circumvent the Security Council. We also call for \\nthe lifting of the blockade of Cuba. Cooperation rather \\nthan isolation should be the method for settling \\nconflicts in the twenty-first century. \\n The ongoing transformation in contemporary \\ninternational relations makes it a priority task on the \\nglobal agenda to expand intercultural, interreligious \\nand inter-civilization dialogue in order to devise \\napproaches to the problems of the modern world that \\nare based on shared values. The degradation of \\nfundamental moral values leads to the degradation of \\nsociety. The recent tragic events in Norway, riots in \\nGreat Britain, protests by young people in other \\ncountries, and calls to suppress Christian minorities in \\nthe Middle East and North Africa — all of those events \\nare the result of a deterioration in moral and ethical \\nvalues. There can be no freedom without responsibility \\nand no democracy without self-restraint. There is a \\nclear and urgent need to counter the threats posed by \\nnationalism, ethnic and religious intolerance. We \\ntherefore reiterate the importance of the recent High-\\nlevel Meeting of the General Assembly to \\ncommemorate the tenth anniversary of the adoption of \\nthe Durban Declaration and Programme of Action \\nagainst racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and \\nrelated intolerance. \\n Attempts to falsify or revise history are \\ninadmissible, all the more so given that we are marking \\nthe sixty-fifth anniversary of the Nuremberg Tribunal \\nverdict. Political correctness and talk of freedom of \\nspeech cannot serve as a cover when, in certain \\nEuropean countries, people who brought disgrace upon \\nthemselves by cooperating with the Nazis are being \\ntalked and written about in an increasingly elevated \\ntone. Russia will never forget the countless military \\ncrimes committed by Hitler and his associates in our \\nland and throughout Europe during the years of the \\nNazi aggression. \\n The rapid changes taking place in the world make \\nit imperative to strengthen the role of the United \\nNations and to adapt it to contemporary realities while \\npreserving — naturally — its inter-State character and \\nthe immutability of its Charter principles. A \\nfundamental element of the Organization’s renewal is \\nthe reform of the Security Council. We support a \\nsolution that is based upon the broadest possible \\nagreement. \\n The world community faces many challenges, \\nand the United Nations, as a major mechanism for \\nglobal regulation, is today in demand as never before. \\nTogether we will find practical ways to effectively \\novercome the threats of the twenty-first century.',\n",
       " '\\ufeffOn behalf of the\\nRepublic of Kazakhstan, I would like to congratulate\\nyou, Mr. Jeremić, on your election to the presidency\\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session, as\\nwell as to wish you every success. I also wish to express our appreciation to Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz\\nAl-Nasser, President of the General Assembly at its\\nsixty-sixth session, for his skillful steering of the\\nAssembly’s proceedings.\\nIn recent years, the world has lived through\\nmajor political, social, economic and environmental\\nupheavals. The geopolitical turmoil in the Middle\\nEast, as well as natural and man-made disasters, serve\\nas compelling evidence indicating that the issues of\\nsecurity, stability and sustainable development are\\nbecoming increasingly relevant.\\nWe believe that world politics should be based on\\nnew global principles. In the twenty-first century, those\\nprinciples encompass constructive multipolarity and\\ntransparency, trust and political tolerance, and the clear\\npre-eminence of evolutionary forms of development\\nof the world. They should be enshrined in the core\\ndocuments of the United Nations and in the entire\\ninternational law system. In that context, we believe\\nthat it is fundamentally important to ensure strict\\nadherence to the principle of non-interference in the\\ninternal affairs of Member States.\\nThe threat of the proliferation of nuclear weapons\\nand technology, along with the spectre of their\\nacquisition and use by terrorist entities, has been one\\nof the most daunting challenges to humankind. It is\\nour strongly held view that the possession of weapons\\nof mass destruction is not a guarantee of security or\\ngreater independence. Kazakhstan’s own record shows\\nthat countries reap huge benefits from the renunciation\\nof nuclear weapons. By voluntarily giving up the world’s\\nfourth-largest nuclear arsenal and shutting down the\\nlargest test site in Semipalatinsk, on 29 August 1991,\\nwe have won more friends and have become a more\\nprosperous, stable and inf luential country.\\nKazakhstan fully supports the proposal by\\nthe Secretary-General to adopt a nuclear weapons\\nconvention. Sharing its declared goals, His Excellency\\nMr. Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, President of the Republic\\nof Kazakhstan, suggested that, as an important step\\nin that direction, the United Nations should adopt a\\nuniversal declaration of a nuclear-weapon-free world.\\nThat would, undoubtedly, facilitate our advancement\\ntowards a nuclear-weapon-free world and an early\\nadoption of a nuclear weapons convention. Kazakhstan\\nwelcomes the establishment of a constructive dialogue\\nwith the five nuclear Powers with a view towards signing\\na protocol on negative security assurances to the State parties to the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in\\nCentral Asia.\\nWe also call for an early establishment of a nuclear-\\nweapon-free zone in the Middle East. In that regard, we\\nlook forward to the upcoming conference in Helsinki\\nand its positive outcomes.\\nKazakhstan is working on the practical\\nimplementation of a project to host an international\\nbank of low-enriched uranium, under the auspices of\\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency, which would\\nallow, if need be, to ensure an uninterrupted supply of\\nnuclear fuel. It should be made clear that the bank will in\\nno way infringe upon the inalienable right of each State\\nparty to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\\nWeapons to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes,\\nincluding the development of nuclear technology.\\nThis year, we will complete the project to enhance\\nphysical security of the former Semipalatinsk test site.\\nWe view this project, which is being implemented jointly\\nwith the United States and Russia, as our significant\\ncontribution to the global non-proliferation regime.\\nKazakhstan is actively involved in the fight\\nagainst international terrorism and drug trafficking,\\nwithin the framework of the Collective Security\\nTreaty Organization, the Shanghai Cooperation\\nOrganization and the Conference on Interaction and\\nConfidence-building Measures in Asia (CICA). As\\nChair of the Collective Security Treaty Organization,\\nKazakhstan consistently works to strengthen regional\\ncooperation in this area. Special attention has been paid\\nto the expansion of practical cooperation between the\\nUnited Nations and regional arrangements, including,\\nin particular, the Kazakhstan-based Central Asian\\nRegional Information and Coordination Centre for the\\nfight against the threat of drug trafficking, which is\\ndesigned to enhance multilateral cooperation to counter\\nthe f low of drugs from Afghanistan.\\nGiven the increasing attention by the international\\ncommunity to the issue of international information\\nsecurity, we believe that the time has come to consider\\nthe introduction of new concepts into international law,\\nsuch as electronic borders and electronic sovereignty,\\nas well as the establishment of a cyberpolice unit.\\nAs the current Chair of the Council of Foreign\\nMinisters of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation,\\nKazakhstan will continue to fully support the process\\nthat aims to bring stability and peace back to the region\\nof the Middle East and North Africa.\\nBefore I turn to regional issues, let me express our\\nstrong condemnation of the Internet video and cartoons\\nthat provocatively offend the religious feelings of\\nMuslims. Such disgusting incitements must be\\nstopped, because they lead to an escalation of violence\\nby fomenting hatred between the representatives of\\nreligions, and they undermine inter-civilizational\\ndialogue and confidence-building. The right to freedom\\nof expression must be exercised with due responsibility.\\nWe were shocked by the tragic killing of United\\nStates diplomats in Benghazi. We condemn attacks\\non diplomats and diplomatic missions and call upon\\nGovernments to adhere to their international obligations\\nto protect diplomatic representatives in their countries.\\nWe should support all efforts to find a peaceful\\nsolution to the conflict in Syria and assist in preventing\\na humanitarian disaster. We should also take measures\\nto prevent any spillover of the crisis to the rest of the\\nregion. To that end, both the Syrian Government and\\nthe opposition should resort to diplomacy, not arms,\\nand put an immediate end to the violence.\\nThe principles of sovereignty and non-interference\\nin internal affairs must be respected. It is the Syrians\\nthemselves who should determine the future of their\\ncountry. We call on all nations to unite around the\\nSyrian transition process, which should be based on\\ndialogue and compromise, and support the activities of\\nthe Joint Special Representative of the United Nations\\nand the League of Arab States for Syria, Mr. Lakhdar\\nBrahimi.\\nKazakhstan calls for the creation of conditions\\nto settle the Palestinian issue, including through the\\ncontinuation of direct Palestinian-Israeli talks. All\\nobstacles to the negotiation process should be removed.\\nKazakhstan has been and continues to be a supporter of\\nthe legitimate rights of Palestine to establish a sovereign\\nand independent State, within the 1967 borders, and its\\nentry into the United Nations as a full member.\\nWe have consistently advocated a peaceful,\\nexclusively diplomatic, resolution of the situation\\naround the Iranian nuclear programme and look forward\\nto the continuation of constructive dialogue between\\nIran and all interested parties with a view to developing\\nmutually acceptable solutions.\\nThe reconstruction of Afghanistan is an important\\nobjective of the international community that meets the\\naspirations of the Afghans themselves. We believe that, if our cooperation on Afghanistan is to be successful,\\nits economic dimension should be a priority. Efforts to\\nstabilize the situation should be bolstered by reforms\\naimed at sustainable development and the improvement\\nof socioeconomic indicators in the country, its level of\\neducation and other human standards.\\nKazakhstan is also actively involved in multilateral\\ncooperation to assist Afghanistan, as demonstrated\\nby its readiness to host, in 2013 in Astana, the next\\nconference of the Istanbul process.\\nAlmaty, the southern megalopolis of Kazakhstan,\\nhas the necessary facilities to accommodate the offices\\nof international organizations. Sixteen organizations\\nof the United Nations family have already set up their\\noffices in the city. Most of them enjoy a regional status.\\nWe promote further expansion of the presence of United\\nNations organizations, including its humanitarian\\nagencies, and offer to establish a United Nations\\ncentre in Almaty, in order to effectively coordinate\\ninternational efforts and implement regional projects\\nof the United Nations, including those dealing with\\nassistance to Afghanistan.\\nThis year, we mark the twentieth anniversary of the\\ninitiative to convene the Conference on Interaction and\\nConfidence-building Measures in Asia, announced by\\nPresident Nursultan Nazarbayev at the forty-seventh\\nsession of the General Assembly, on 5 October 1992 (see\\nA/47/PV.24). The anniversary session and the fourth\\nmeeting of CICA Foreign Ministers, held in Astana\\non 12 September, have become important milestones\\nin the evolution of that Asian forum. Currently, the\\nConference brings together 24 countries that occupy\\nover 90 per cent of the territory of Asia, where half of\\nthe world’s population now resides. As a platform for\\ndialogue, CICA has an important role to play in efforts\\nto ensure peace, security and stability in Asia.\\nKazakhstan urges that close attention be paid to the\\nexpansion of the trade, investment and transit transport\\ncapacity of least developed countries, landlocked\\ndeveloping countries (LLDCs) and small island\\ndeveloping States. To advance the interests of these\\ngroups of countries, Kazakhstan, together with the\\nUnited Nations, organized, from 12 to 14 September in\\nAlmaty, the fourth meeting of LLDC Trade Ministers\\nand the high-level global thematic meeting on\\ninternational trade, trade facilitation and aid for trade.\\nToday, the whole world is facing new challenges to\\nglobal energy security. Central Asia has great potential\\nto become a global energy centre. The development\\nof energy resources is a priority for the Republic of\\nKazakhstan. In our vision, the future of the region lies\\nin the development of the oil and gas pipeline system to\\ndeliver our hydrocarbon resources to Europe and Asia.\\nAs a follow-up to the United Nations Conference\\non Sustainable Development and to draw the attention\\nof the international public to the issues of renewable\\nsources of energy, Kazakhstan has decided to seek\\nthe nomination of its capital, Astana, as the host of\\nthe international exhibition Expo 2017 on the subject\\nof “Energy for the Future”. We count on fellow\\nMember States to support our bid. As one of the pilot\\ncountries selected from among States Members of the\\nUnited Nations, Kazakhstan will actively promote the\\ndevelopment of draft sustainable development goals for\\nthe period beyond 2015.\\nKazakhstan is not only in a position to ensure its\\nown food security; it is also willing to contribute to\\nglobal food security.\\nIntercultural dialogue is an important prerequisite\\nfor peace and security. To promote such dialogue,\\nKazakhstan put forward an initiative to proclaim an\\nInternational Decade for the Rapprochement of Cultures\\n2013-2022, which was adopted at the conclusion of the\\nthirty-sixth session of the United Nations Educational,\\nScientific and Cultural Organization General\\nConference, in November 2011.\\nKazakhstan attaches special importance to the\\nprotection of human rights and has announced its\\nbid for membership in the Human Rights Council\\nfor the period 2012-2015. If elected, Kazakhstan will\\nparticipate, with a full sense of responsibility, in the\\nproceedings of that important human rights body, on\\nthe basis of an open, impartial, non-politicized and\\nmutually respectful dialogue between the Member\\nStates of the United Nations.\\nLast March, the Republic of Kazakhstan celebrated\\nthe twentieth anniversary of its membership in the\\nUnited Nations. All these years, we have consistently\\nstood for an inclusive, transparent and effective\\nOrganization. We strongly believe that it is only by\\nuniting our efforts that we can make real progress in\\naddressing the global issues and challenges facing\\nhumanity. We therefore call for joint efforts to seek\\nsolutions to common problems for the benefit of future\\ngenerations and our common planet Earth.',\n",
       " 'I have the honour to speak on behalf of the Community \\nof Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), \\nover which Cuba currently has the honour to preside. I \\nreiterate our satisfaction at the election of Ambassador \\nJohn Ashe of Antigua and Barbuda as President of the \\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I also \\nreiterate our willingness to cooperate with him for the \\nsuccess of this session. It is an honour for CELAC to \\nsee a representative from one of its member States, \\nin particular a Caribbean nation, preside over this \\npreeminent body of the United Nations.\\n\\nOver the coming weeks, I will also speak to the \\nAssembly about the heroic struggles of Cuba, its \\nresistance and triumphs, the immense efforts of its \\npeople, its fidelity to principles, its revolutionary \\ntransformations and the perfection of Cuban socialism.\\n\\nAs the first genuinely Latin American and \\nCaribbean organization that includes all of the countries \\nin the region, CELAC was founded with the purpose \\nof making progress in the political, economic, social \\nand cultural unity and integration of our America, so \\nas to reclaim the dream of our liberators of a nation of \\nrepublics that, with its almost 600 million inhabitants, \\nits resources and its enormous human and economic \\npotential, can decide autonomously its own destiny.\\n\\nThe countries of our region share the conviction \\nthat the political, economic, social and cultural unity \\nand integration of Latin America and the Caribbean \\nconstitute not only a fundamental aspiration of our \\npeoples, but also a prerequisite for us to successfully \\ntackle the challenges we face as a region. However, \\neverything that has been achieved so far and the path \\nCELAC has chosen underscore the need for our region \\nto have a space of its own to consolidate and project \\nthe Latin American and Caribbean identity based on its \\nshared principles and values and on the ideals of unity \\nand democracy for our peoples. It should also reaffirm \\nour commitment to building a more just, equitable and \\nharmonious international order based on respect for \\ninternational law and the principles of the Charter of the \\nUnited Nations, and to upholding the sovereignty and \\nthe right of each State to build its own political system, \\nfree from threat, aggression or unilateral coercive \\nmeasures and in an environment of peace, stability, \\njustice, democracy and respect for human rights.\\n\\nOur Community is based on unrestricted respect \\nfor international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes \\nand the prohibition of the use and threat of use of force; \\non respect for the self-determination, sovereignty and \\nterritorial integrity of States and on non-interference in \\ntheir internal affairs; on the protection and promotion \\nof all human rights, the rule of law, at both the national \\nand the international levels, and democracy; and on our \\naim to work together for collective prosperity so as to \\neradicate discrimination, inequality, marginalization, \\nhuman rights violations and transgressions of the rule \\nof law.\\n\\nWe reaffirm our region’s commitment to \\ninternational peace and security. We commit to \\nstrengthening the climate of peace that prevails in \\nLatin America and the Caribbean and to consolidating \\na zone of peace that encompasses our region as a \\nwhole, whereby disputes between nations are resolved \\npeaceably through dialogue and negotiation or other \\nmeans, in perfect harmony with international law.\\n\\nAt the recent High-level Meeting on Nuclear \\nDisarmament (A/68/PV.11), CELAC reiterated its \\nprofound concern at the threat posed to humankind \\nby the continued existence of nuclear weapons and \\ntheir possible use or threat of use, and the urgent need \\nto make progress towards the priority objective of \\nnuclear disarmament and achieve the total and absolute \\nelimination of nuclear weapons. In addition, CELAC \\nmember countries presented for the first time a joint \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\ninitiative to the Human Rights Council on the right to \\npeace, which we hope will lead to a declaration on that \\nright for adoption by the General Assembly.\\n\\nCELAC has expressed its support in the strongest \\nterms for the legitimate rights of Argentina in the \\ndispute over the sovereignty of the Malvinas Islands. \\nThe continuing position of our region is that the United \\nKingdom should agree to reopen negotiations with a \\nview to finding a peaceful and definitive solution to \\nthat dispute as soon as possible.\\n\\nOur Community reiterates its support for the \\ndialogue under way between the Government of \\nColombia and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias \\nde Colombia, which seeks to end the internal conflict \\nthat has affected the political, social and economic \\ndevelopment of that sister nation for more than 50 years. \\nWe hope that that initiative will succeed in reaching an \\nagreement in the interests of the Colombian people.\\n\\nWe would also like to underscore the Latin \\nAmerican and Caribbean character of Puerto Rico \\nand, by taking note of the resolutions on Puerto Rico \\nadopted by the Special Political and Decolonization \\nCommittee, to emphasize that that issue is a matter of \\ninterest to CELAC.\\n\\nWe reiterate our absolute condemnation of terrorism \\nand reaffirm our commitment to fighting it in all its \\nforms and manifestations, in keeping with the United \\nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. However, \\nat the same time, we strongly reject the unilateral and \\nillegitimate assessments, lists and certifications made \\nby some developed countries that affect countries of \\nour region, in particular those referring to terrorism, \\ndrug trafficking, human trafficking and other similar \\nphenomena.\\n\\nIn recent days, as the situation in Syria has \\ndeteriorated, CELAC has reiterated its vocation for \\npeace and its observance of the principles enshrined in \\nthe Charter of the United Nations and in international \\nlaw, including international humanitarian law. It has \\nurged the creation of the conditions necessary for \\nmoving towards a negotiated political solution to \\nthe Syrian conflict, which has claimed the lives of \\nthousands of innocent people.\\n\\nSimilarly, CELAC is working to identify \\nindependent concepts and mechanisms for cooperation, \\nurging the international community to continue to \\ncontribute to the reconstruction and sustainable \\ndevelopment of our sister Republic of Haiti, in \\naccordance with the fundamental priorities and needs \\ndefined by the Haitian Government and in full respect \\nfor its authority and sovereignty and the principles of \\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of countries.\\n\\nWe have defended the sovereignty of the region, \\nincluding that over our own natural resources, \\nand we have expressed our solidarity with States \\nmembers of CELAC in the face of harmful acts that \\nviolate international law, such as that of 2 July, which \\nthreatened the dignity and rights of the President of the \\nPlurinational State of Bolivia, Mr. Evo Morales Ayma, \\nas he returned to La Paz from a visit to a number of \\nEuropean countries. \\n\\nTaking into account the diverse processes that \\nhave shaped Latin American and Caribbean identity, \\nthe Community has also emphasized its intention to \\nbecome a space that protects the rights to live, thrive \\nand coexist enjoyed by all cultures, races and ethnic \\ngroups of the region, as well as the multicultural nature \\nof our peoples and the plurinational character of some \\nof our countries, especially among native communities \\nthat are promoting and recreating their historical \\nmemory, ancestral knowledge and their experience.\\n\\nAlmost seven months after he passed away, CELAC \\ntoday pays a well-deserved tribute to one of its founding \\nmembers, President Hugo Chávez Frías, who presided \\nover the founding summit of the Community with his \\nvision and mastery. Similarly, CELAC expressed its \\nsatisfaction over the election of Pope Francis as the \\nfirst High Pontiff of the Catholic Church from the Latin \\nAmerican and Caribbean region.\\n\\nThe global espionage against CELAC member \\ncountries violates human rights, the right to privacy, the \\nright of citizens to be informed, and the principles of \\nState sovereignty and international law. It has become \\na source of concern, and we have taken due note of the \\nstatements made in various forums by Heads of States \\nand Government and other leaders of Latin American \\nand Caribbean countries who have condemned and \\nrejected the use of such practices.\\n\\nThe member States of CELAC are proud of their \\nshared work in consolidating our regional sovereignty so \\nthat the Latin America and Caribbean region can occupy \\nits rightful place in the world and renounce its status \\nas the most inequal region on Earth. In pursuing these \\nobjectives, we have decided to offer the most vulnerable \\ncountries of the region our cooperation and solidarity \\nand to draw attention to the special vulnerabilities \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nof the countries of the Caribbean Community, given \\ntheir status as small island developing States, which \\nlimits their efforts towards sustainable development, \\nespecially in light of the significant impact of natural \\ndisasters and the negative effects of climate change.\\n\\nWith regard to the indispensable reform of the \\ninternational system, we have renewed our countries’ \\ncommitment to multilateralism, the comprehensive \\nreform of the United Nations system, and the \\ndemocratization of international decision-making \\nforums, in particular the Security Council. We shall act \\naccordingly on issues of equal importance, among them \\nthe process of formulating the post-2015 development \\nagenda, which is the theme of this general debate and \\nto which all CELAC member countries attach great \\nimportance.\\n\\nThe members of CELAC know that there can be \\nno lasting peace without development and without \\ncombating poverty, hunger and inequality. We are \\naware of the challenges that the current international \\neconomic and financial crisis poses to the future of our \\nregion and our legitimate aspirations to social inclusion, \\nequitable growth with sustainable development, and \\nintegration. We therefore emphasize the importance \\nfor the post-2015 development agenda to consist of \\nvoluntary, universal, clear and quantifiable goals \\nthat can be adapted to distinct national realities, with \\nthe purpose of eradicating poverty and promoting \\nsustainable development. This new framework should \\nbe inclusive and transparent on official development \\nassistance, prompt the developed countries to honour \\ntheir commitments, and encourage South-South and \\ntriangular cooperation on cross-cutting issues through \\nthe participation of all sectors of society.\\n\\nWith regard to climate change, we welcome the \\nformal adoption of the second phase of commitments \\nunder the Kyoto Protocol, despite a lack of political \\nwill on the part of a number of developed nations that \\nvetoed agreements on new, additional and predictable \\nresources and on mechanisms for the effective transfer \\nof technologies to developing countries. We will \\ncontinue to work together to cope with this scourge that \\naffects humankind as a whole today.\\n\\nThere are many difficulties, but the important \\nthing is that the countries of Latin American and the \\nCaribbean have come to the conclusion that the time \\nhas come for the region, as José Martí said, to walk in \\nclose ranks, like silver in the roots of the Andes. That is \\nwhy we created CELAC.\\n',\n",
       " 'At the outset, on behalf \\nof the people and the President of the Bolivarian \\nRepublic of Venezuela, Mr. Nicolás Maduro Moros, I \\nwould like to convey to General Assembly President \\nJohn Ashe our congratulations on his recent election to \\nlead this organ of the United Nations. \\n\\nAs is known, President Maduro Moros is not here \\nat this session of the General Assembly because of a \\nwhole range of delays, obstacles, conditions imposed \\nand lack of guarantees for him and members of his \\ndelegation, imposed by the Government of the United \\nStates in flagrant violation of the obligations incumbent \\nupon it under the Headquarters Agreement. Despite \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nthat, we have come here on behalf of the people of the \\nliberator, Simón Bolívar, to speak the truth and to ask \\nsome questions, firmly but respectfully, as we learned \\nfrom our leader, Hugo Chávez Frías, who passed away \\nin March. In that regard, on behalf of my people, I \\nshould like to express our gratitude for the heartfelt \\ntribute paid to President Chávez Frías last March (see \\nA/67/PV.67).\\n\\nHow happy we would be to be here if we were \\nreally in a place where we realized the noble ideals \\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. The \\nCharter talks about saving succeeding generations \\nfrom the scourge of war, but the truth is that various \\nmilitary interventions have been decided upon or have \\nbeen allowed here that have engulfed countries and \\nwhole regions of the world in long wars and instability. \\nThe Security Council has been taken hostage by the \\nhawks of war, and when they can, they justify their \\nattacks from there; when they cannot, they simply bang \\non the table and still do whatever they want, which is \\nwhat they are doing when they declare that there will be \\nfuture bombings in the Syrian Arab Republic.\\n\\nThe Charter also states that the purpose of the \\nOrganization is to preserve international peace and \\nsecurity. But let me ask: How do some members of the \\nSecurity Council think we can achieve that purpose by \\narming and protecting terrorist groups such as Jabhat \\nAl-Nusra and Al-Qaida, which are obscurantist forces? \\nMany of those groups are linked to horrible acts such as \\nthe destruction of the Twin Towers in this very city. They \\ndeny the existence of anybody who thinks differently \\nfrom them — whether they be Christians, Muslims \\nor Jews — and profess special hatred and rejection of \\nwomen. Why are such groups supported? Why do some \\nmembers of the Security Council sponsor such terrorist \\ngroups, window-dressing them as political opposition \\nand even allowing them to give press conferences at this \\nvenue? What would representatives of Governments \\nwith ongoing internal armed conflicts say if the violent \\ngroups they faced were to be given space and a voice \\nhere at Headquarters to justify their downfall?\\n\\nThe Preamble of the Charter also sets out another \\nnoble goal: to promote social progress and raise the \\nstandard of living in a broader concept of freedom. \\nIn reality, however, poverty, hunger and injustice are \\ncontinuing to grow and the standard of living and the \\nstandard of freedoms are falling lower and lower. That \\nis because what is imposed on us is a model of excluding \\nothers — a neo-fascist model — a neo-liberal model.\\n\\nIn the meantime, countries such as Venezuela \\nhave chosen the path to consolidate real democracy \\nwith a socialist system, including the people, and that \\nhas enabled us to reach the Millennium Development \\nGoals. Yet we are constantly attacked and demonized \\nand our political and social stability is being disrupted. \\nThat is what is happening at this very moment with \\nthe anti-democratic opposition in our country, which \\nis being supported by media corporations in the region \\nand from the whole world.\\n\\nParagraph 4, Article 2, of the Charter of the United \\nNations emphatically states that \\n\\n“All members shall refrain in their international \\nrelations from the threat or use of force against the \\nterritorial integrity or political independence of \\nany state”. \\nYet the President of the United States — and there is \\nthe additional irritant that he is a Nobel Peace Prize \\nlaureate — is threatening to bomb this or that country if \\nit does not comply with his country’s unilateral demands, \\nwhich can even include removing a Government that \\nthe United States Government does not like. Perhaps \\nthat could explain why, despite the fact that the Charter \\ntalks about the equality of large and small nations, the \\nPresident of the United States said just a couple of days \\nago that the United States was “exceptional”. Does that \\nmean that they are not equal with the other 192 States \\nMember States represented here?\\nThe gap today between the noble ideals of the \\nCharter and what is happening by act or omission \\nhere in the Organization is truly alarming. Why does \\nnobody in the General Assembly venture to propose \\nthat sanctions be imposed for open violations of the \\nCharter on the Government that has an illegal detention \\ncentre in the military base at Guantánamo, in occupied \\nCuban territory, where torture and cruel and degrading \\nand inhuman treatment is being meted out to persons? \\n\\nWhy does nobody discuss sanctions against \\nthe President who has admitted to illegal espionage \\nactivities against Heads of State and Government \\nrepresented here? That was a point courageously \\nmade by the President of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff (see \\nA/68/PV.5).\\n\\nWhy do we not consider the use of unpiloted \\nplanes — so-called drones — which have taken the \\nlives of tens of thousands of innocent victims, including \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nchildren and old people, in North Africa, the Middle \\nEast and parts of Asia to be crimes against humanity? \\n\\nWhy do we not impose sanctions against a \\nGovernment that for more than 50 years has maintained \\nan illegal and criminal economic blockade against the \\nworthy Cuban people, and flouted decisions adopted by \\noverwhelming majorities in the Assembly in favour of \\nending the embargo?\\n\\nWhy do we not implement the resolutions adopted \\nby the plenary so that the State of Palestine can be \\nestablished as a peaceful, just and lasting solution to \\nthe ongoing Arab-Israeli conflict? \\n\\nWhy does the United Kingdom not agree to start \\nnegotiations with Argentina to resolve in a peaceful \\nway demands over the Malvinas Islands? Might it \\nperchance be because the elite of the United States and \\nsome of its allies are exceptional?\\n\\nWe raise those questions for consideration when it \\ncomes to the future of humankind, on behalf of the people \\nof Simón Bolívar — the people of Venezuela — who \\nlove peace, equality and freedom. \\n\\nVenezuela has come before the General Assembly \\ntoday to condemn a kidnapping. The Organization has \\nbeen kidnapped. The peace and dignity of the world \\nare being held hostage in New York. The kidnapper has \\nmany faces. It changes names and sometimes even flags, \\nbut it continues to be the same old imperalism. Eight \\nyears ago, Commander Hugo Chávez Frías — a tireless \\ndefender of genuine peace, not the peace imposed by \\nbombs, and of participatory democracy and a leader \\nfor unity among peoples — called here for a genuine \\ntransformation of the United Nations. Seven years ago, \\nhe said that there was a whiff of sulphur here (see A/61/\\nPV.12). Today, alas, I have to say once again that there is \\nstill a whiff of sulphur coming from those who consider \\nthemselves exceptional.\\n\\nThose words are truer now than ever before. The \\ncourageous revelations of one young man offered a \\ngreat service to humankind — let us call it a wake-up \\ncall. As a result, he is now being persecuted politically \\nand cannot walk freely in the streets of Manhattan. We \\nhope that Edward Snowden will one day be able to walk \\nfreely among a future generation of Americans who \\nhave taken back their civil rights and helped to ensure \\npeace in the world. That young man has shown us how \\nthe privacy of every human being has been violated by \\nthe most complex and sophisticated spying system that \\nhumankind has ever been able to come up with.\\n\\nThanks to those revelations this year, we have \\nwoken up to discover that George Orwell’s 1984 is \\nnow here. And what is the United Nations doing about \\nthat? Who is setting limits on so much arbitrariness \\nand running roughshod? Those are yet more questions \\nthat find no answers from the General Assembly or the \\nSecurity Council of the Organization, which is now \\nalmost 68 years old.\\n\\nWe would like to suggest that the Secretary-General \\nset up a body within the United Nations to ensure for \\nevery inhabitant in the world the right to privacy and \\nthe right to communicate without interception. Much \\nhas been said here calling for peace, but that has often \\nfallen on deaf ears. Let us hope that we will all learn \\nhow important it is to listen to the calls of the people for \\npeace, and employ that in tirelessly seeking to elevate \\nhuman dignity as our guiding star.\\n\\nPresident John Kennedy spoke from this rostrum \\n50 years ago, the last time he would do so at the United \\nNations before being assassinated. How good it would \\nbe if his current successor, and many people here, \\nwere to re-read just some of what he said. Whatever \\ndifferences we may have had with that historic figure, \\nensuring peace requires that we seek out areas of \\nagreement such as this:\\n\\n“For the value of this body’s work is not \\ndependent on the existence of emergencies — nor \\ncan the winning of peace consist only of dramatic \\nvictories. Peace is a daily, a weekly, a monthly \\nprocess, gradually changing opinions, slowly \\neroding old barriers, quietly building new \\nstructures. And, however undramatic the pursuit of \\npeace, that pursuit must go on.” (A/PV.1209, p. 5)\\nLet us hope that the leaders of the United States and \\nthose that follow them blindly will think deeply about \\nthe meaning of what Kennedy said and realize that if \\nthey really want to be exceptional, they have to find \\nexceptional ways of bringing about lasting peace in the \\nworld.\\nIn Latin America and the Caribbean we are \\nshowing that with exceptional decisions and actions we \\ncan build a world of peace. Unity in diversity is what \\nwe have in our regional organizations: the Bolivarian \\nAlliance for the Peoples of Our America, the \\nCommunity of Latin American and Caribbean States, \\n\\n\\n\\x0c\\nthe Union of South American Nations, the Common \\nMarket of the South and Petrocaribe. All those are tools \\nfor democratizing our societies that promote socially \\ninclusive economic development and ensure political \\nstability. Despite various internal disputes and conflicts \\nbetween fraternal countries, we have been able to find \\nmechanisms for the peaceful settlement of conflict. We \\nhave demonstrated that without military intervention, \\ndrones or economic blockades, we can build and \\npreserve genuine democracy and move forward in \\ncombating hunger, poverty and inequality.\\n\\nThe Venezuelan nation is proud of being part of a \\nregion that is free of weapons of mass destruction. We \\nreaffirm our commitment to encouraging the complete \\nelimination of nuclear weapons and chemical and \\nbacteriological weapons as a way of ensuring that life \\ncan continue on planet Earth.\\n\\nIn his various statements before the Assembly, \\nCommander Chávez Frías called for improving the \\nmeans for addressing problems and resolving conflicts \\nin a transparent manner. He also pointed out that, in \\nthe face of today’s reality, there was a crucial need \\nto consider whether the Headquarters of the United \\nNations should be here in this country where the \\nGovernment does not respect the Organization, much \\nless the sovereignty of each and every State Member. \\nThe United Nations should be in a place where there \\nis respect for all Members; where the political will \\nflourishes, without pressure or fear, to end conflict in \\nthe world through dialogue; where the path forward \\nis genuine social development and the elimination of \\nhunger and poverty; and where what matters is how to \\nstop war, not how to justify it.\\n\\nLet us take the United Nations to the South, where \\nthe antithesis to exclusion — solidarity — has often \\ntaught us that we are in fact all equal. For now, we \\nwelcome the proposal of President Evo Morales Ayma \\nthat we should meet in the Organization’s various other \\nheadquarters in different parts of the world. Beyond the \\nshadows that seem to darken the future of the human \\nrace, from Latin America and the Caribbean we are \\nsaying and showing that another world is possible \\nwhere all of us can, in peace and dignity and with \\njustice, enjoy lives worth living.\\n',\n",

I commend the report he introduced earlier in the \\ncurrent session on the work of the Organization (A/69/1). \\nIt demonstrates the daunting responsibility assumed by \\nour Organization in creating an environment conducive \\nto seeking appropriate solutions to the problems and \\nchallenges that we all face.\\n\\nThe inaugural statement by the Secretary-General \\nat the opening of the general debate (see A/69/PV.6) shed \\nlight on a number of the challenges facing us, including \\nclimate change, the spread of diseases, particularly the \\nEbola epidemic in West Africa, the aggravated refugee \\nproblem, the propagation of extremism, policies \\nof exclusion, violence, violations of human rights, \\nparticularly those affecting women, and issues related \\nto health, education and food security.\\n\\nMy country supports the Secretary-General’s \\nurgent call to conclude a global climate agreement at the \\nforthcoming Lima and Paris conferences and stresses \\nthe importance of the Green Climate Fund, designed to \\nmitigate the effects of climate change.\\n\\nIt is a matter of particular pride for me to mention \\nthe vigorous efforts undertaken by the Kingdom of \\nBahrain and the resulting successes in countering \\nthe numerous challenges and instability currently \\nfacing the region. As classified by the United Nations \\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) 2014 Human \\nDevelopment Report — which is based on objective \\nstatistical criteria regarding, first and foremost, health \\ncare, education, per capita income and the equality of \\nwomen — the Kingdom of Bahrain is ranked among the \\ncountries with “very high human development”. That is \\na status achieved through persistent hard work, and we \\nwill endeavour to maintain it.\\n\\nThose goals, however, have never been an end in \\nthemselves. The principal objective is to achieve the \\nwell-being of Bahraini citizens and to protect all those \\nwho live within the borders of the Kingdom, an oasis of \\nsecurity and calm enjoyed equally by all.\\n\\nI am pleased to recall in that context the award \\nbestowed on His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa \\nby the Foundation for Coexistence among Religions in \\nrecognition of His Majesty’s outstanding contributions \\nin the field of dialogue among civilizations and \\ncultures. I also note that the fourteenth Conference on \\nAll Civilizations in the Service of Humanity was held in \\nManama in early May under the high-level patronage of \\nHis Majesty the King and with the participation of the \\nUnited Nations and a distinguished group of thinkers, \\nscholars and opinion-makers. The Conference adopted \\nthe Bahrain Declaration, which has been circulated and \\ndeposited as an official document of the United Nations \\n(A/68/959, annex).\\n\\nAdditionally, I would like to mention His Majesty’s \\ninitiative to establish an Arab human rights tribunal. \\nThe initiative has been approved by all States members \\nof the League of Arab States, and the statute has been \\nadopted. I would also like to mention the launch in \\nBahrain in November 2013 of the UNDP report Water \\nGovernance in the Arab Region, which calls for the \\nadoption of a joint Arab water-management strategy.\\n\\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain has continued to play an \\nenergetic role in the United Nations system, where it \\nseeks to further progress through gradual and steady \\nreform and modernization along the lines envisaged by \\nHis Majesty the King. Such reform would be based on a \\nstrategy of common denominators, continuous and open \\ndialogue and a national exchange of views — the same \\nstrategy as led to the early achievement of the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals. Accordingly, the strategies and \\npreparations for the post-2015 development agenda are \\nalso based on tireless work, determination, persistence, \\ngood faith and comprehensive planning and are aimed \\nat promoting continual and enhanced progress and \\nserving the interests of the Kingdom’s citizens and \\nresidents alike.\\n\\nOur region is going through a phase of extreme \\ndifficulty — probably the most difficult in its modern \\nhistory — in which a climate of instability, chaos, \\ntension and savage, bloody and unprecedented terrorism \\nprevails. Of the many contributing factors, the most \\nsalient are the following.\\n\\nFirst, the accelerated emergence of terrorist groups \\nof various global dimensions and affiliations. They \\nthrive in our region, exhibiting the greatest savagery \\nand callousness. Not only do they target innocent \\npeople in general, they also engage in such inhumane \\npractices as mass murder, public beheadings and the \\npersecution of ethnic and religious minorities, which \\nthey displace, destroying their cultural heritage, \\ndepriving them of religious freedom and causing them \\nto flee their homes. They attack entire cities and declare \\nwar on sovereign countries in regional and international \\nsettings, in complete disregard of all religious doctrines \\nand the intrinsic human values — tolerance, equality, \\nmoderation and respect for cultural diversity — that \\nhave enabled human civilizations, including our Arab \\nand Islamic civilization, to coexist. These terrorist \\ngroups — they include Al-Qaida, the Islamic State in \\nIraq and the Levant (ISIL) and Hizbullah, and their \\nextensions and counterparts — recruit their fighters \\nfrom both East and West and perpetrate horrific terrorist \\nacts. The young and the old alike are killed, women are \\ntaken as war bounty, families are displaced and privacy \\nis violated, the objective being to undermine security, \\npropagate anarchy and topple regimes.\\n\\nTherefore, combating terrorist groups requires \\nus to work together in three main areas. The first of \\nthese is the security and military area, owing to the \\nworsening threat posed by these terrorist groups as they \\nacquire heavy weapons, enabling them to occupy cities \\nfor use as safe havens and bases from which to launch \\nthe terrorist operations that disrupt the stability and \\nsecurity of our region.\\n\\nWe share a common responsibility with friendly \\ncountries and our allies is to eradicate the terrorist group \\nof ISIL. To that end, our air force, in collaboration with \\nthese countries, has targeted a number of ISIL positions. \\nWe welcome Security Council resolution 2178 (2014), \\nadopted on 24 September, which focuses on stopping \\nthe recruitment of foreign terrorist fighters. Also, we \\ncontinue to closely monitor borders and exit and entry \\npoints so as to stop citizens of the Kingdom from \\ncontacting or joining terrorist groups and to arrest and \\nprosecute all those who have allegedly been affiliated \\nto them as soon as they return to the country.\\n\\nSecondly, we must combat all ideology that runs \\ncounter to human nature and betrays true Islam by \\ndistorting its precepts. Muslim clerics and scholars can \\nplay an important part in counteracting such distortion. \\nWe therefore call on all Muslim scholars to expose and \\ndisown ideas that are not related to Islam in any way, \\nand we appreciate their playing a leading role in that \\nrespect. It is imperative to stand together in the face of \\nthe ideas propagated by the terrorist groups.\\n\\nThirdly, we must deal with financing, as it \\nconstitutes the lifeline of the terrorist groups, enabling \\nthem to perpetrate their barbaric acts, purchase \\nweapons and influence some young people. In that \\nconnection, the Kingdom of Bahrain will convene \\na high-level international conference during the \\nfirst week of November to consider the financing of \\nterrorism, how best to combat such financing and how \\nto deprive terrorism of its sources of finance. We firmly \\nbelieve that preventing the financing of terrorism will \\nsignificantly contribute to overcoming terrorism and to \\neradicating it.\\n\\nThe second challenge to the security and stability of \\nour region is that of political expansionism and attempts \\nto impose hegemony, in disregard of the sovereignty \\nof States, and to interfere in their internal affairs. All \\nthe countries of the region, without exception, have \\nsuffered from such issues as a result of attempts to \\nexport seditious revolutions and to train terrorists \\nin violation of international law and the principles \\nof the United Nations. Such attempts represent an \\nideology that is archaic in its political dimension and \\nin its defiance of the values and principles enshrined in \\nnumerous international instruments.\\n\\nOne form of such interference is the exploitation of \\nthe media, in particular satellite television channels and \\nsocial media, which are misused in order to distort facts \\nand to cause instability in the region. We condemn such \\nillegal and illegitimate practices, which contravene \\ninternational values and principles.\\n\\nI would like to point out what the Republic of \\nYemen endures. With each step that it takes forward, \\nterrorist groups rush to pursue their criminal objectives \\nby undermining its stability and security. The Kingdom \\nof Bahrain reaffirms its support for President Abdrabuh \\nMansour Hadi Mansour and his tireless efforts to \\nstrengthen the national consensus achieved through a \\n\\n\\ncomprehensive national dialogue on the basis of the \\nGulf Cooperation Council initiative and the relevant \\nSecurity Council resolutions.\\n\\nTurning to Iraq, which has suffered from flagrant \\ninterference, insecurity, hegemony and anarchy, we see \\nsome hope in the positive developments in the country. \\nWe are pleased to welcome the election of President Fuad \\nMasum and the establishment of the new Government \\nunder Prime Minister Haider Al-Abadi. We hope \\nthat such a development will enhance the political \\nand development processes, thereby contributing to \\nthe consolidation of Iraq’s security and stability, the \\npreservation of its sovereignty and territorial integrity \\nand the strengthening of its links with its fellow Arabs \\nin the region where it naturally belongs.\\n\\nThe conflict in Syria becomes more complex and \\nmore acute every year. Innocent civilians are paying \\nthe ultimate price and losing their lives, property and \\ndignity. The humanitarian situation deteriorates daily \\nin the absence of a comprehensive political solution to \\nsafeguard the lives of the Syrian people and to extricate \\nthat beloved country from its protracted suffering \\nthrough a comprehensive political process aimed at \\nachieving reform and political plurality. With regard to \\nthe humanitarian aspect, we reiterate that it is necessary \\nto overcome all impediments to the delivery of \\nhumanitarian assistance to those in need, in accordance \\nwith the relevant Security Council resolutions.\\n\\nIn that respect, I wish to express my country’s \\ngreat appreciation for the humanity shown by the \\nsisterly Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in hosting \\nand delivering assistance to Syrian refugees. We also \\nappreciate the humanitarian role played by Turkey and \\nLebanon, as well as by the Office of the United Nations \\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees.\\n\\nWith regard to the Arab Republic of Egypt, \\nthe Kingdom of Bahrain welcomes the democratic \\ndevelopment that has taken place in that country \\nand the implementation of the road map through the \\nestablishment of a Constitution that reflects the will of \\nthe Egyptian people. We also welcome the presidential \\nelections and the ongoing preparations for the holding \\nof legislative elections so as to complete the State \\ninstitutions under the Constitution.\\n\\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain reiterates its complete \\ncondemnation of any interference in the internal affairs \\nof Egypt. We support the efforts of President Abdel \\nFattah Al Sisi and the steps that he has taken to combat \\nterrorism, to preserve the security and stability of \\nEgypt and to pursue its strategic and active role at the \\nArab, regional and international levels. In that regard, \\nI would like to commend the initiative taken by the \\nCustodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah \\nBin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, King of the Kingdom of Saudi \\nArabia, in announcing the convening of an Egyptian \\neconomic summit in support of Egypt and its economic \\ndevelopment.\\n\\nWe reiterate the historical, principled and constant \\nposition of the Kingdom of Bahrain in solidarity with \\nthe Kingdom of Morocco and our full support for its \\ninitiatives with regard to self-government for the \\nMoroccan Sahara within Moroccan sovereignty and \\nterritorial integrity, in accordance with international \\nlegitimacy.\\n\\nWith regard to Libya, the Kingdom of Bahrain \\nwishes to express its grave concern about the \\ndeteriorating security situation as a result of the \\nviolent acts perpetrated by terrorist groups and \\nthe repercussions of such acts on the stability of \\nneighbouring countries. The Kingdom of Bahrain \\nsupports the legitimate constitutional institutions \\nrepresented by the elected House of Representatives \\nand welcomes the establishment of the new Government \\nunder Mr. Abdallah Al-Thani. We hope that such a \\ndevelopment will help to establish security and stability \\nand to preserve the unity and territorial integrity of that \\nsisterly country.\\n\\nIn view of our keen interest in striving to achieve \\nour principal goal, namely, to protect humankind \\nfrom the scourge of war, conflict and disaster and to \\ncondemn attempts at hegemony and destabilization, we \\nreiterate our call to make the Middle East, including \\nthe Arab Gulf region, a zone free of weapons of mass \\ndestruction, in particular nuclear weapons. On the basis \\nof that principle, we support the efforts of the P5+1 \\nto promptly find a solution to the issue of the Iranian \\nnuclear programme, in accordance with the provisions \\nof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \\nWeapons and the Convention on Nuclear Safety, without \\nprejudice to the use of nuclear technology for peaceful \\npurposes. Such use is a natural right of all States under \\nthe international safeguards system.\\n\\nThe third and last challenge is the illegal occupation \\nof the territory of other States in breach of the principles \\nof international law and the Charter of the United \\nNations, as demonstrated by Israel’s violation of all \\n\\n\\ninternational laws, agreements and decisions and its \\ntargeting of the Palestinian people by confiscating their \\nland, by building or expanding settlements thereon and \\nby imposing blockades on them. Such violations found \\ntheir ugliest expression in the most recent criminal \\naggression against the Gaza Strip, which resulted in \\ntremendous damage and caused the death of more than \\n2,000 martyrs, the displacement of a great number of \\nPalestinians and the destruction of infrastructure.\\n\\nI would like to recall the words of \\nPresident Mahmoud Abbas in his statement before \\nthe General Assembly, his request that international \\nprotection be provided to the Palestinian people and \\ntheir territories under occupation and his demand that \\nIsrael abide by the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 \\n(see A/69/PV.12). It is imperative to have a specific \\ntime frame for an end to the Israeli occupation and to \\nachieve the aspirations of the Palestinian people for the \\nestablishment of an independent Palestinian State on \\nall its territory within the boundaries of 4 June 1967, \\nwith East Jerusalem as its capital, as stipulated under \\nthe Arab Peace Initiative and the two-State solution, \\nin accordance with international legitimacy and the \\nrelevant United Nations resolutions.\\n\\nIn that context, we commend the pivotal role \\nplayed by the Arab Republic of Egypt in order to \\nreach a ceasefire in Gaza. We greatly appreciate its \\nhosting, in cooperation with the Kingdom of Norway, \\nan international conference in support of Palestine and \\nthe reconstruction of the Gaza Strip next month. We \\nalso commend the important role of the United Nations \\nRelief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the \\nNear East.\\n\\nWith regard to the occupation by the Islamic \\nRepublic of Iran of the three islands Greater Tunb, \\nLesser Tunb and Abu Musa, which belong to the United \\nArab Emirates, the Kingdom of Bahrain reiterates its \\nconsistent position condemning that occupation. We \\ncall on Iran to heed the efforts of the United Arab \\nEmirates to resolve the issue through direct negotiations \\nor through the arbitration of the International Court of \\nJustice.\\n\\nThose are the key challenges facing our region. \\nIf we overcome them, it will be relatively easy for us, \\nwithin our common responsibilities, to address the \\ninternational challenges that the Secretary-General \\ndescribed in his statement, to which I referred at the \\nbeginning of my statement. If we focus on those very \\nserious issues, we will be on the right path towards true \\nsustainable development and the necessary reform to \\nmeet the aspirations of all peoples.\\n\\nNotwithstanding the challenges that we all face, the \\nKingdom of Bahrain will always remain committed to \\nmoving forward on the path of development, reform and \\npositive interaction with the international community \\nin order to achieve our aspirations and objectives. In \\nthat respect, the Kingdom of Bahrain, in line with its \\nfirm approach towards reform under the leadership \\nof His Majesty the King, will continue to work for \\nthe upholding of the rule of law, pluralism and active \\npolitical participation. We look forward to the elections \\nto be held on 22 November, so as to consolidate all our \\nachievements.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I would like to underscore the \\nfact that in the Kingdom of Bahrain our choices are \\nclear. Our vision is comprehensive and our strategy \\ncomplementary to and in line with our Gulf, Arab and \\ninternational contexts. The Kingdom always seeks to \\npromote stability, peace, security, development and the \\nprotection of human rights. It rejects and condemns \\nterrorism, violence and hatred and works for a society \\nin which harmony and consensus prevail for the benefit \\nof all and for the establishment of a promising future \\nfull of opportunity and achievement for all future \\ngenerations.\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'This year \\nmarks the centenary of the outbreak of the First World \\nWar. A distinguished thinker in modern China, Yan Fu, \\ndescribed the devastation caused by the war: “How sad \\nthat the air is heavy with the stench of war”.\\n\\nNext year will be the seventieth anniversary of the \\nend of the Second World War. Over 2 billion people \\nacross the world were affected by that calamity. In \\nChina alone, the aggression committed by Japanese \\nmilitarists left more than 35 million Chinese soldiers \\nand civilians dead or injured.\\n\\nThe United Nations was established to keep the \\nscourge of the two World Wars from occurring again, \\nand it embodies the fervent hope of all countries for \\npeace and stability. To achieve that goal, the Charter \\nof the United Nations presented a grand vision of joint \\nefforts to build a better world.\\n\\nIn this world, we should treat each other as equals. \\nThe principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity \\nmust be upheld. The pursuit by different countries of \\neconomic and social development must be respected. \\nTheir right to independently choose their own social \\nsystems and development paths must be safeguarded. \\nWe should be open and inclusive. Only in that way \\ncan we open the door of dialogue and exchange and \\nachieve harmony among countries with different social \\nsystems, religions and cultural traditions. We should \\npursue mutually beneficial cooperation. Each country \\nshould align its own interests with those of others and \\nwork to maximize areas where their interests converge.\\n\\nOnly by helping one another can countries prosper. \\nWe should jointly initiate a new thinking for win-win \\nand all-win progress and reject the old notion of a zero-\\nsum game, or the winner takes all. We should uphold \\njustice. It is imperative to promote greater democracy \\nand the rule of law in international relations, to apply \\nfair and just rules to tell right from wrong and settle \\ndisputes, and to pursue peace and development within \\nthe framework of international law. All parties should \\njointly uphold the authority and effectiveness of the \\nUnited Nations and reform and improve the global \\ngovernance structure.\\n\\nAs we have seen in Gaza, Iraq, the Central African \\nRepublic and South Sudan, our world is far from \\npeaceful. In the face of all those who have been killed \\nin war, we must ask ourselves how we can keep the \\ntragedies from recurring. In the face of women and \\nchildren displaced by fighting, we must ask ourselves \\nwhen they can return home. In the face of incessant \\nconflicts, we must ask ourselves how we can open the \\ndoor to lasting peace. To address those problems, China \\nbelieves that we should do the following.\\n\\nFirst, we should seek political solutions. To beat \\nswords into ploughshares may take time and effort, but \\nhistory and reality have repeatedly demonstrated that \\nto meet violence with violence will not lead to enduring \\npeace, and the use of force will only create more \\nproblems than solutions. Coercive action should be \\nauthorized by the Security Council. If a country places \\nits domestic law above international law and interferes \\nin other countries’ internal affairs at will, or even seeks \\nregime change, the international community cannot but \\nquestion the legitimacy of its actions.\\n\\nSecondly, we should accommodate the interests \\nof all parties. Parties to a conflict should reject the \\nzero-sum approach, address each other’s concerns in \\nnegotiations and endeavour to meet each other half \\nway. They should seek to meet their legitimate concerns \\nthrough consultations in a mutually accommodating \\nway. When conducting mediation, the international \\ncommunity should uphold justice and take an objective \\nand balanced position. Countries should not be partial \\nto any party in the conflict. Still less should they avail \\nthemselves of the opportunity to pursue their own \\nagenda.\\n\\nThirdly, we should promote national reconciliation. \\nThe ongoing armed conflicts are largely caused by \\nethnic and sectarian tensions. The process of national \\nreconciliation and the process of political settlement \\nshould be advanced in tandem with each other. All \\nparties should uphold the Charter of the United \\nNations, develop and practice a culture of inclusion and \\ntolerance and uproot the seeds of hatred and retaliation, \\nso that the fruit of inclusion and amity will grow on \\npost-conflict land.\\n\\nFourthly, we should uphold multilateralism. We \\nshould give full play to the role of the United Nations \\nand observe international law and the basic norms \\ngoverning international relations. Chapter VII of the \\nCharter is not the only means for the Security Council \\nto maintain international peace and security. We should \\nmake better and full use of the means of prevention, \\nmediation and conciliation stipulated in Chapter VI.\\n\\nGiven their familiarity with local developments, we \\nshould leverage the strengths of regional organizations \\nand countries and support them in addressing regional \\nissues in ways suited to their regions.\\n\\nThe conflicts in Ukraine remain a cause of \\nconcern. We welcome and support the Minsk ceasefire \\nagreement and urge all parties in Ukraine to strictly \\n\\nimplement it and seek a comprehensive, sustained \\nand balanced political solution through political \\ndialogue and negotiation. China hopes that the various \\nethnic groups in Ukraine will live in harmony and \\nthat Ukraine will live in peace with other countries. \\nThat is the fundamental way for Ukraine to achieve \\nlong-term stability and security. China hopes that \\nthe United Nations will play its due role in finding a \\nproper solution to the Ukrainian crisis and supports the \\ninternational community’s constructive efforts to ease \\nthe humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine.\\n\\nChina supports Iraq in upholding its sovereignty, \\nindependence and territorial integrity. The formation of \\nthe new Iraqi Government has provided an important \\nopportunity. We hope that the Iraqi Government will \\nlead its people in a joint endeavour to develop their \\ncountry in the spirit of inclusion and reconciliation. \\nChina calls for providing more humanitarian assistance \\nto support Iraq. To help the Iraqi people overcome \\ndifficulties and to achieve peace and stability in their \\ncountry is the shared responsibility of the international \\ncommunity.\\n\\nChina firmly opposes all terrorist acts and supports \\nthe international community in responding to the \\nthreat posed by terrorist forces in a coordinated and \\nconcerted way in accordance with the relevant Security \\nCouncil resolutions. China believes that in conducting \\ninternational counter-terrorism cooperation, we should \\ntake a multipronged approach and address both the \\nsymptoms and root causes of terrorism, and that the \\nUnited Nations and the Security Council should fully \\nplay leading roles. There should be no double standard \\nwhen it comes to fighting terrorism; still less should \\nterrorism be identified with any particular ethnic group \\nor religion.\\n\\nAs new developments emerge in the global fight \\nagainst terrorism, the international community should \\ntake new measures to address them. In particular, it \\nshould focus on combating religious extremism and \\ncyberterrorism, resolutely eliminate the root causes of \\nterrorism and extremism, block channels that spread \\nthem and crack down hard and effectively on the use of \\nthe Internet and other new means of communication by \\nterrorists to instigate, recruit, finance or plot terrorist \\nattacks.\\n\\nThe Syrian crisis has continued for nearly four \\nyears. It is negotiation, not fighting, that offers \\nsolutions. China urges all parties in Syria to end the \\nfighting and violence immediately, cooperate fully with \\nUnited Nations humanitarian assistance operations and \\nhelp bring an end to the suffering of innocent civilians \\nas soon as possible. We urge all the parties to act in the \\noverall interests of the future and fate of their country \\nand people, demonstrate the necessary political will, \\nactively support the mediation efforts of the Secretary-\\nGeneral and his Special Envoy, and follow a middle \\nway that draws on workable practices from other \\ncountries and regions, suits Syria’s national conditions \\nand accommodates the interests of various parties, in \\norder to give peace a chance.\\n\\nThe Palestinian issue is an open wound on the \\nconscience of humankind. China calls on Israel \\nand Palestine to agree on a durable ceasefire, and it \\nurges Israel to lift its blockade of the Gaza Strip and \\nstop building settlements. At the same time, Israel’s \\nlegitimate security concerns should be respected. We \\nhope that Israel and Palestine will choose the way of \\npeace and resume and advance the peace talks as soon \\nas possible. The aspirations and legitimate demands of \\nthe Palestinian people for an independent nation must \\nnot remain unmet indefinitely. Advancing peace in the \\nMiddle East calls for the concerted efforts of many, not \\nof one or two countries alone. The Security Council \\nshould play its rightful role, and we support its efforts \\nto take action in response to the demands of Palestine \\nand the League of Arab States.\\n\\nNegotiations on the Iranian nuclear issue have \\nentered a crucial stage. All the parties should display \\ngood faith, continue their efforts in a spirit of mutual \\nrespect, equality, collaboration and accommodation, \\nand work hard on the most difficult issues, so that a \\nwin-win agreement that is comprehensive, fair and \\nbalanced is arrived at as soon as possible.\\n\\nThe two sides of the conflict in South Sudan \\nshould establish a ceasefire immediately, organize an \\nactive political dialogue that addresses the interests \\nof the people in South Sudan in general and, through \\nthe mediation of the Intergovernmental Authority \\non Development, work with all the country’s ethnic \\ngroups and parties to speedily reach a fair and balanced \\nsolution and achieve national reconciliation and ethnic \\nunity. South Sudan is the youngest Member of the \\nUnited Nations. The South Sudanese people deserve a \\nlife of hope and vitality, not the devastation caused by \\nconflicts and wars.\\n\\n\\nChina welcomes the election of Mr. Ashraf Ghani \\nas the new President of Afghanistan and Mr. Abdullah \\nAbdullah as its Chief Executive, and will continue to \\nsupport the Afghan people in their work to achieve a \\nsmooth political, security and economic transition and \\nto build jointly with them an Afghanistan that enjoys \\nunity, stability, development and amity. We support \\nan Afghan-led and -owned peace process, with the \\ninternational community fulfilling its commitment and \\nresponsibility to Afghanistan and its people. China will \\nhost the Fourth Ministerial Conference of the Istanbul \\nProcess so that we can give Afghanistan fresh support \\nas it stands on the threshold of a new era.\\n\\nOn the issue of the Korean peninsula, China calls \\non all the parties to act objectively and impartially, \\nremain committed to the goal of denuclearizing the \\npeninsula, firmly uphold its peace and stability, and \\nendeavour to resolve the issues through dialogue and \\nconsultation. The Six-Party Talks remain the only \\nviable and effective way to resolve the nuclear issue on \\nthe Korean peninsula, and we now have the pressing \\ntask of restarting the talks as soon as possible. The issue \\nshould be tackled through a sustainable, irreversible \\nand effective dialogue process that addresses all the \\nparties’ concerns in a comprehensive and balanced \\nway. Since there are still many uncertainties on the \\npeninsula today, all the parties concerned should \\nexercise restraint, refrain from provocative acts, work \\nharder to help ease tensions and jointly uphold peace \\nand stability.\\n\\nWhile the Millennium Development Goals \\n(MDGs) established by the United Nations in 2000 \\nhave contributed greatly to improving human survival \\nand development, global development is still a task for \\nthe long term. The international community is not only \\ndealing with the formidable challenges of reducing \\npoverty, eradicating hunger and improving education \\nand the health of women and children, it is also facing \\nnew challenges in the form of the environment, climate \\nchange and energy and resource security.\\n\\nNext year is the deadline for meeting the MDGs, \\nand the post-2015 development agenda will take \\nover this historic mission. Building on past progress \\nand also breaking new ground, the international \\ncommunity should formulate more effective plans \\nand take more robust action to advance humankind’s \\nshared development. As we see it, the development \\nagenda should have three goals. First, it should advance \\npeople’s well-being, with a focus on eradicating \\npoverty and encouraging development. Secondly, \\nit should promote inclusiveness, in the interests of \\nsupporting social equity and justice. Thirdly, it should \\nensure the implementation of all these things. Based \\non the principles of diversity in development models \\nand shared but differentiated responsibilities, the \\nagenda should aim to enhance global partnerships for \\ndevelopment and improve implementation tools and \\nmechanisms.\\n\\nClimate change is a challenge that all humankind \\nis facing. Mr. Zhang Gaoli, Vice Premier of the State \\nCouncil, led the Chinese delegation to this year’s \\nClimate Summit at the United Nations as a special \\nenvoy of China’s President. We congratulate the \\nUnited Nations on the Summit’s success and hope that \\nthe political momentum it generated will translate \\ninto effective actions for improving international \\ncooperation on climate change. All parties should \\nwork to conclude negotiations on a new post-2020 \\nclimate-change regime as scheduled, by the end of \\n2015, in accordance with the principles of shared but \\ndifferentiated responsibilities, equity and respective \\ncapabilities, with the aim of creating fairer and more \\nequitable and effective arrangements for international \\ncooperation on climate change.\\n\\nThe Ebola epidemic, which is raging in some \\nAfrican countries, has once again sounded the alarm \\non global health security. As a good brother and partner \\nof Africa, with whom it shares the good and the bad, \\nChina will continue to stand firmly with the African \\npeople and to support and assist them to the best of its \\nability. We will also take an active part in the relevant \\ninternational assistance efforts. China calls on the \\nWorld Health Organization, the United Nations and \\nother international agencies to work closely with the \\ninternational community, come up with new initiatives \\nfor strengthening global health security and provide \\nmore assistance to developing countries, particularly in \\nAfrica.\\n\\nNext year is one of special historic significance, \\nas it marks the seventieth anniversary of victory in \\nthe anti-fascist world war, the founding of the United \\nNations and victory in the Chinese people’s war against \\nJapanese aggression. Remembering the past makes us \\ncherish peace, and recalling history will help to guide \\nus as we embrace the future. China welcomes the \\ninclusion of the seventieth anniversary of the end of the \\nSecond World War on the agenda of this session of the \\nGeneral Assembly as an important opportunity.\\n\\nWhen we look back on what happened 70 years \\nago, the historical facts are clear, and a final verdict \\nhas been pronounced on what was right and what was \\nwrong. History should not be falsified or truth distorted. \\nToday, 70 years later, let us jointly uphold human \\njustice and conscience so that those who attempt to \\ndeny aggression and distort history will have nowhere \\nto hide. Let us jointly defend the Charter of the United \\nNations and the outcomes of the Second World War, \\nso that that vision of a world free of war, with lasting \\npeace, will take deep root in our hearts and pass from \\none generation to the next.\\n',\n",
       " 'We live in a globalized world that is moving towards \\nmultipolarity in an age characterized by the threat to \\nthe survival of the human species. The United States \\nGovernment and NATO will not be able to reverse that \\ntrend with a new world division through the force of \\narms. However, there is a serious risk that in trying to \\ndo so, they render the world ungovernable.\\n\\nThe huge nuclear and conventional arsenals \\nthat have been built up, the imposed annual military \\nexpenditure that amounts to $1.75 trillion and the \\nincrease in military budgets to 2 per cent of the gross \\ndomestic product required of all States members of \\nNATO will not help to address or to resolve issues such \\nas poverty, hunger, epidemics or waves of migration or \\nto overcome the global economic, environmental. food, \\nenergy and water crises.\\n\\nAs has already been demonstrated, wherever the \\nso-called unconventional warfare described in the 2010 \\nUnited States Special Forces Army Training Circular \\n18-01 and the innovations of the 2010 United States \\nQuadrennial Defense Review are practised, chaos \\nensues through the destabilization or destruction \\nof States, the proliferation of violent and extremist \\ngroups and the tearing apart of nations, cultures and \\nreligions, thereby seriously jeopardizing regional and \\ninternational peace and security. It is necessary to \\ncondemn the militarization of cyberspace and the illegal \\nand covert interference in the information systems \\nof some countries in order to use them in aggressive \\nactions against third countries to stir up conflict, as \\nwell as global espionage on Governments and entire \\nsocieties.\\n\\nThe extraterritorial application of United States \\nlaws to the detriment of other sovereign nations is \\nbecoming increasingly aggressive and encourages \\nthe use of unilateral sanctions, in particular financial \\nsanctions, as a tool of foreign policy. The use of its \\ncourts of justice to impose multimillion-dollar fines, \\nincluding on its allies, under decisions that violate \\ninternational law, has become a means of punishment \\nand threat and a way to spuriously obtain financial \\nresources. Governments, by failing to defend their own \\nsovereignty and to apply their own laws so as to protect \\nthe standards of the international financial system and \\n\\nthe legitimate interests of their nations and those of their \\ncompanies and citizens, are creating the conditions \\nnecessary for the proliferation of such practices, which \\njeopardize the independence of all States and the rule \\nof international law.\\n\\nMedia empires, increasingly linked to the \\nhegemonic goals of the Western Powers, continue their \\nmisinformation campaigns, shamelessly and cynically \\nmanipulate facts and create public opinion matrices \\nthat promote aggression. We need another international \\norder, where there is no room for the philosophy of war \\nand the plundering of natural resources.\\n\\nThe foreign intervention in Syria must stop. It is \\ninconceivable that Western Powers encourage, finance \\nand arm terrorist groups to set them against a State, \\nwhile trying to combat their crimes in another State, as \\nis now happening in Iraq. The United States Government \\nviolates international law when it launches, in contempt \\nof the United Nations, unilateral bombings without \\nrespect for sovereign borders or States under the guise \\nof dubious coalitions.\\n\\nThe attempt to deploy NATO up to Russia’s borders \\nwill have serious consequences for international peace \\nand security and for the stability of Europe. The \\nsanctions against Russia are immoral and unjust. The \\nstrategic American deployment in the Asia-Pacific \\nregion will create dangers for the sovereignty of all \\nnations in the area.\\n\\nIsrael’s crimes against the Palestinian people, \\nmost recently in the Gaza Strip, should not remain \\nunpunished under the protection of a veto in the \\nSecurity Council. Palestine should already be a State \\nMember of the United Nations, established within the \\n1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.\\n\\nThe General Assembly must exercise the \\nprerogatives conferred on it by the Charter of the \\nUnited Nations in the current dangerous and unstable \\ninternational situation, which is full of threats and \\nchallenges. The Security Council should be rebuilt \\non the basis of democracy, transparency and the fair \\nrepresentation of the countries of the South, which are \\ndiscriminated against, as permanent and non-permanent \\nmembers. It should be built on credibility and strict \\nobservance of the Charter, without double standards, \\nobscure procedures or the anachronistic veto. The \\nOrganization needs profound reform and the defence \\nof its principles. The Secretary-General should be the \\ndefender and guarantor of international peace.\\n\\nThe 1.2 billion people who live in extreme poverty, \\nthe 842 million people who suffer chronic hunger, \\nthe 774 million illiterate adults and the 57 million \\nuneducated children affirm that the Millennium \\nDevelopment Goals — which are questionable from \\na methodological point of view — were a mirage. \\nThere has been and still is a lack of political will in \\nthe Governments of industrialized States, where \\nblindness and ineffective selfishness prevail. Insatiable \\ntransnational businesses increasingly focus on the \\nownership of huge resources. The unequal distribution \\nof wealth is increasingly ruthless.\\n\\nIt is necessary, inevitably, to establish a new \\ninternational economic order. In these circumstances, \\nthe discussions on the post-2015 development agenda \\ngive us little reason to hope. However, we must try \\nto reach agreement, as that is the most urgent task. It \\nmust be the result of an inclusive intergovernmental \\nnegotiation. The resulting document should not be the \\ninterpretation of a few parties to the consensus, but \\nrather of the consensus itself.\\n\\nIt is urgent to make sub-Saharan Africa a priority. \\nIt is essential to confront jointly and decisively, with \\nsufficient and genuine cooperation, the Ebola epidemic \\nthat is affecting some countries of the continent. Cuba \\nhas decided to maintain its medical cooperation in the \\n32 African countries where more than 4,000 specialists \\nare working and is willing to extend its cooperation, \\nunder the auspices of the World Health Organization \\n(WHO), to other, most affected countries, as has been \\nreported. Our doctors and paramedics will do so \\ncompletely voluntarily.\\n\\nWe call on the international community, particularly \\nindustrialized countries with substantial means, to \\nforcefully respond to the call of the United Nations \\nand WHO to supply financial, health and scientific \\nresources right away in order to eradicate the scourge \\nand prevent it from claiming more lives. The necessary \\nresources should also be contributed to support the \\nAfrican Union’s Agenda 2063, which sets forth the road \\nmap for the development of the region.\\n\\nIn the past five decades, 325,000 Cuban health \\nworkers have assisted 158 nations of the South, including \\n39 African countries, where 76,000 have worked. Also, \\n38,000 physicians were trained free of charge in 121 \\ncountries; of those, 3,392 were in 45 African nations. \\nIf Cuba, small and subject to a blockade, has been able \\nto do that, how much more could have been done for \\n\\nAfrica with the cooperation of all, especially of the \\nrichest States?\\n\\nAt the second Summit of the Community of \\nLatin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), in \\nHavana, we agreed on what is needed to achieve the \\ngoal of making societies more just and inclusive. It \\nis indispensable that there be a better distribution of \\nwealth and income, the eradication of illiteracy, quality \\neducation for all, real food security, health systems \\nwith universal coverage, and the fulfilment of other \\nhuman rights.\\n\\nThe solemn Proclamation of Latin America and \\nthe Caribbean as a zone of peace, signed by the Heads \\nof State and Government, enshrines respect for the \\nprinciples and norms of international law, the promotion \\nof a culture of peace, nuclear disarmament and general \\nand complete disarmament, and the inalienable right of \\nevery State to choose its political, economic and social \\nsystem. We also undertook to make Latin America \\nand the Caribbean a region free from colonialism and \\nexpressed support for the inalienable right of the people \\nof Puerto Rico to self-determination and independence.\\n\\nThe Havana summit recognized that the current \\neconomic, financial and environmental crises have \\ndelivered particularly harsh blows to small island \\ndeveloping States, including the nations of the \\nCaribbean. Their efforts to improve the welfare of \\ntheir populations should not be punished by calling \\nthem middle-income countries through schematic \\ncalculations of per capita income, without taking into \\naccount their specificities and vulnerabilities.\\n\\nIn CELAC, the region of Latin America and the \\nCaribbean has found a native and legitimate space \\nto forge from its rich diversity the essential unity to \\nfulfil the dreams of our heroes, achieve the complete \\nindependence of “Our America” and make a substantial \\ncontribution to creating balance in the world. In that \\neffort, there have been significant developments — the \\nmeeting between the Union of South American Nations \\nand Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, China and \\nSouth Africa (BRICS); the meeting between the \\nleaders of China and the countries of Latin America \\nand the Caribbean; and the establishment of the China-\\nCELAC Forum in Brasilia in July, as had been agreed \\nin Havana. We welcome the Fortaleza Declaration, \\nalso adopted in July in Brazil, at the sixth summit of \\nthe BRICS countries — whose economies account for \\n25 per cent of world gross domestic product and almost \\n40 per cent of the population of the planet — as well \\nas the setting up of a development bank and a foreign \\nexchange reserves common fund, which are important \\nfor the countries of the South and for the construction \\nof a new international financial architecture.\\n\\nWe express our solidarity with the Bolivarian \\nand Chavista revolution, which, under the leadership \\nof President Nicolas Maduro, is battling to fend off \\ndestabilizing actions and foreign interference. We \\nsupport the worthy fight being waged by Argentina \\nagainst speculative capital funds, and we oppose the \\ninterventionist decisions of the United States courts \\nthat are violating international law. In addition, we \\nreiterate our strong support for the legitimate rights \\nof Argentina with respect to the Malvinas Islands. We \\nalso reiterate our unwavering support for the fight that \\nEcuador is leading against the ecological pillaging \\nand damage caused by the activities of transnational \\ncompanies.\\n\\nOn the eve of the International Decade for People \\nof African Descent (2015-2024), we would recall that \\nthis year we celebrate the 210th anniversary of the \\nindependence of Haiti, whose anti-slavery and pro-\\nindependence revolution was the precursor of liberation \\nmovements in Latin America and the Caribbean. Haiti \\ndeserves special contributions for its reconstruction \\nand development, under the sovereign leadership of its \\nGovernment, in which we encourage the international \\ncommunity to participate. We support the claim of the \\nCaribbean to receive reparations from the colonial \\nPowers for the horrors of slavery.\\n\\nThe State Department has again put Cuba on \\nits unilateral and arbitrary list of State sponsors of \\ninternational terrorism. Its real purpose is to increase \\nscrutiny of our international financial transactions \\nworldwide and justify the policy of blockade. During \\nthe current Administration, there has been a tightening \\nof the extraterritorial dimension of the blockade, with \\na strong and unprecedented emphasis in the financial \\nrealm, through the imposition of huge fines on banking \\ninstitutions in third-party countries. An example of this \\nis the scandalous and unjust mega-fine imposed on the \\nFrench bank BNP Paribas. Furthermore, the current \\nAdministration has not stepped back from promoting \\ndestabilization in Cuba. It allocates millions of dollars \\nto that end in its budget every year and increasingly \\nrelies on undercover methods, such as the use of \\ninformation and communications technology. The \\nZunZuneo project, sponsored by the United States \\nAgency for International Development (USAID), which \\n\\nnot only violates Cuban law but also the law of its own \\ncountry, is the latest evidence of that.\\n\\nRecent disclosures about the use of young people \\nfrom our continent in subversive actions in Cuba, \\na project funded and executed by USAID, confirm \\nthat the Cuban Government is right in its countless \\ndenunciations of the ongoing illegal plans of the \\nUnited States to subvert Cuba’s internal order, in \\nviolation of Cuban sovereignty, the sovereignty of \\nthird countries and international law. We cannot fail \\nto remember that this month marks the sixteenth year \\nof the unjust imprisonment of three Cubans from the \\nCuban Five — Gerardo, Ramón and Antonio — who \\nwith the utmost altruism confronted the terrorist plans \\norganized within United States territory against our \\ncountry. I therefore reiterate, on behalf of the people \\nand Government of Cuba, that we will not cease in our \\nefforts to call for their return to their homeland.\\n\\nCuba, for its part, remains calm and prepared for \\nmutually respectful and responsible dialogue, based \\non reciprocity, with the United States Government. \\nAt the same time, Cuba continues to make progress \\nin the updating of its socioeconomic model, despite \\nadverse international circumstances marked by a global \\neconomic crisis and the tightening of the blockade.\\n\\n\\nUpdating Cuban’s economic socialist model is \\naimed at ensuring well-being, equity and social justice \\nfor all Cubans. The changes that we are introducing \\nare also geared to preserving the achievements of the \\nRevolution, which so many generations have fought for. \\nThe goal is to build an ever more just, prosperous and \\nsustainable Cuban socialism.',\n",
       " 'It was 70 years ago that, on behalf on their peoples, the first Member States of the Organization signed the Charter of the United Nations. We pledged ourselves to preserve future generations from the scourge of war and to build a new type of relationship, guided by a set of purposes and principles that sought to bring about an era of peace, justice and development for all of humanity.\\nHowever, from that moment there have constantly been wars of aggression and interference in the internal affairs of States, the ousting of sovereign Governments\\nby force, so-called soft coups and the recolonization of territories — all perfected by unconventional ways of acting, using new technologies and under the pretext of alleged human rights violations. The militarization of cyberspace and the covert and illegal use of information and communication technologies to attack other States are unacceptable, as is the distortion of the advancement and protection of human rights when used in a selective and discriminatory approach to validate and impose political decisions.\\nDespite the fact that the Charter calls on us to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights and the dignity and worth of the human person, for millions of people the fulfilment of human rights remains a utopia. Humankind has been denied the right to live in peace and the right to development. It is actually in poverty and inequality that the cause of conflicts should be sought — conflicts that were earlier generated by colonialism and the plundering of regional peoples, and later by imperialism and the distribution of spheres of influence.\\nThe commitment made in 1945 to promoting social progress and better standards of living for the peoples, along with their economic and social development, remains an illusion when 795 million people go hungry, when 781 million adults are illiterate, and when 17,000 children perish every day from curable diseases. In the meantime, annual military expenditures worldwide amount to more than $1.7 trillion. Barely a fraction of that figure could actually resolve the most pressing problems afflicting humankind. Even in industrial nations, the welfare society, which was presented as the model to imitate, has practically disappeared. The election systems and the traditional parties, which rely on money and publicity, are growing increasingly detached and distant from the aspirations of their peoples.\\nClimate change is threatening the very existence of the human species. States should assume common but differentiated responsibilities, in view of the indisputable reality that not all countries are equally accountable for what has happened. Not all of us waste natural and human resources through irrational and unsustainable consumerism. The consequences of climate change are particularly for small island developing States and additional tensions to their fragile economies. The same is happening in Africa with the relentless advance of desertification.\\nWe stand in solidarity with our Caribbean brothers and demand that they be treated in a special and differentiated way. We also support the African countries and demand fair treatment for them, as well as the transfer of technology and financial resources.\\nWith the establishment of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), and especially the signing by the CELAC Heads of State and Government in January 2014 of the Proclamation of Latin America and the Caribbean as a Zone of Peace, we have shown that we can move beyond our differences toward unity and the achievement of common goals in the framework of our diversity.\\nIn the Proclamation we reaffirm our steadfast commitment to the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and in international law to settle disputes by peaceful means and our belief that full respect for the inalienable right of each State to choose its political, economic, social and cultural system is an essential condition for ensuring peaceful coexistence among nations. We demand that those principles be the basis for relations with other States in our region.\\nThe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela can always rely on the solidarity of Cuba vis-à-vis the attempts at destabilization and subversion of its constitutional order and the destruction of the work begun by Comrade Hugo Chávez Frías and pursued by President Nicolás Maduro Moros for the benefit of the Venezuelan people. Likewise, our firm and unlimited solidarity goes to the Republic of Ecuador, its citizens’ revolution and its leader Rafael Correa Delgado, who has become the target of the same destabilization script applied against other progressive Governments in the region.\\nWe stand in solidarity with the Caribbean nations demanding fair reparation for the horrors of slavery and the slave trade, above all in a world where racial discrimination and repression of communities of people of African descent have increased. We also reaffirm our conviction that the people of Puerto Rico deserve to be free and independent after more than a century of colonial domination. We stand in solidarity with the Argentine Republic in its fair claim of sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia and South Sandwich islands.\\nWe reiterate our support for and solidarity with President Dilma Rousseff and the Brazilian people in defence of their major social achievements and the stability of their country.\\nWe reaffirm our rejection of the intention to expand the presence of NATO up to the Russian borders, as well as the unilateral and unjust sanctions imposed on that nation.\\nWe welcome the so-called nuclear agreement with the Islamic Republic of Iran, which proves that engagement and negotiations are the only effective tools for settling disputes between States. We renew our confidence that the Syrian people are capable of solving their disputes by themselves and demand an end to external interference in that country.\\nA fair and lasting solution of the Middle East conflict unquestionably requires the true exercise by the Palestinian people of their inalienable right to build their own State within the borders existing prior to 1967, with its capital in East Jerusalem, which we strongly support.\\nOver the past few weeks, we have been moved by the images of waves of migration toward Europe. That is a direct result of the destabilizing actions promoted and executed by NATO in countries of the Middle East and North Africa, as well as of the poverty and underdevelopment prevailing in the countries of the African continent. The European Union should take full and immediate responsibility for the human crisis that it helped to generate.\\nAfter 56 years, during which the Cuban people put up heroic and selfless resistance, diplomatic relations have been re-established between Cuba and the United States of America. Now, a long and complex process begins towards the normalization of relations. But that will be achieved only with the end of the economic, commercial and financial blockade against Cuba, the return to our country of the territory illegally occupied by the Guantanamo naval base, and the cessation of radio and television broadcasts and of subversive and destabilizing programmes against the island. Our people should also be compensated for the human and economic damage that they still endure.\\nWhile the blockade remains in force, we shall continue introducing the draft resolution entitled “Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba”. To all the 188 Governments and peoples that have sponsored our just demand here\\nand in other international regional forums, we reiterate the eternal appreciation of the Cuban people and Government for their continued support.\\nCuba is celebrating with profound commitment the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations. Despite the efforts that have been made throughout those years, not enough has been done to save present and future generations from the scourge of war and to protect their right to sustainable development without exclusions. The United Nations should be defended from unilateralism and should be deeply reformed to democratize it and bring it closer to the peoples.\\nAs Comrade Fidel Castro Ruz, the historic leader of the Cuban revolution, stated in this same Hall 15 years ago\\n“Everyone understands that the United Nations basic role in the new century now upon us is to save the world not only from war but also from underdevelopment, hunger, diseases, poverty and the destruction of the natural resources indispensable to human life. And the United Nations must do this promptly — before it is too late.” The international community can always depend on Cuba to raise its honest voice against injustice, inequality, underdevelopment, discrimination and manipulation and for the establishment of a more equitable and fair international order that really focuses on the human being, his dignity and well-being.\\n',\n",
       " 'I would like to begin by expressing our gratitude to the President and to the Secretary-General for their notable efforts in carrying out their mandates.\\nThe statistics could not be more eloquent — 80 per cent of the world’s population owns only 6 per cent of the wealth, while the wealthiest 1 per cent enjoys half of the world’s patrimony. No less than 795 million people suffer from chronic hunger, and 18,000 children die every day due to poverty. More than 660 million people consume non-potable water, and 780 million adults and 103 million young people are illiterate. It is quite likely that they have never heard of the Millenium Development Goals, but if they had they would scarcely believe in the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\\nThe gap between our deliberations and the realities of our peoples is persistent. The lack of political will of industrialized countries is clear. We see the perpetuation of the irrational patterns of capitalist production and consumption that lead to the degradation of living conditions on our planet. The enormous conventional and nuclear stockpiles and the annual military expenditures of $1.7 trillion contradict those who claim that we lack the resources to end poverty and underdevelopment.\\nHowever, there are many arguments that justify the urgency of building a new international financial architecture. In developed countries, welfare societies are disappearing, political systems are in crisis, pockets of poverty are expanding, brutal neoliberal adjustment programmes are used against workers, young people and migrants, and dark and dangerous neo-fascist forces gain strength.\\nThe philosophy of plundering underpins NATO countries’ military interventions and non-conventional wars against sovereign States as they seek to overthrow Governments and appropriate natural resources. The imposition of unilateral coercive measures and the use of financial, legal, cultural and media tools to destabilize Governments has become our daily bread. The militarization and aggressive use of cyberspace, the violation of the human rights of hundreds of millions of people, and the waves of refugees driven by underdevelopment and NATO interventions towards Europe are evidence of the cruelty, oppressive nature, inefficiency and unsustainability of the current international order, without there being a single response based on respect for human rights and the dignity of persons or aiming at resolving the root causes of the problems.\\nThe year 2015 was also one of the worst in terms of climate change, with mounting global temperatures, the melting of the polar ice caps, the rise in sea levels and an increase in greenhouse-gas emissions. Under these circumstances, we reiterate our solidarity with the small island developing States, especially in the Caribbean, which are the most deeply affected by climate change and for which we demand fair, special and differential treatment.\\nWhile we all expect to see some progress in the fulfilment by industrialized countries of the obligations entered into under the ambiguous Paris Agreement on Climate Change, only tangible data on financing and transfers of technology to developing countries can justify hopes for the survival of the human species. However, capitalism will never be historically or environmentally sustainable.\\nPeace and development are the raison d’être of the United Nations. The creation of a culture of peace and justice as the basis of a new international order is an urgent and imperative need for the human species. Any attempt to prolong the existence of a unipolar world through war, domination or hegemony would be suicidal. The observance of the Charter of the United Nations and international law are indispensable for peaceful coexistence among States.\\nThe United Nations must be defended from unilateralism. At the same time, it needs to be reformed into a more democratic Organization, one that is closer to the problems, needs and aspirations of people. It must be capable of leading the international system towards peace, sustainable development and respect for all human rights for everyone.\\nThe reform of the Security Council, in both its composition and its working methods, is a task that should not be postponed any longer. The strengthening of the General Assembly and the restoration of the functions that were usurped by the Security Council should guide our search for a more democratic and efficient Organization.\\nIt is imperative to find a just and lasting solution to the Middle East conflict, inexorably based on the exercise of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to build its own State within the pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.\\nThe situation of the Western Sahara requires an effort pursuant to the relevant United Nations resolutions to guarantee the self-determination of the Sahrawi people and respect for their legitimate right to live in peace in their territory.\\nOnce again, we reiterate our confidence that the people of the Syrian Arab Republic will be able to resolve their differences on their own when the foreign intervention aimed at promoting regime change ceases.\\nNATO’s attempts to expand its presence closer to Russia’s borders and the deployment of its anti-missile systems are an incentive to the arms race and a threat to international peace and security. Similarly, we express our opposition to the unjust and unilateral sanctions imposed against the Russian people that are also harmful to Europe.\\nCuba, which has been the victim of State terrorism, reiterates its strong condemnation of all forms and manifestations of terrorism.\\nThe Proclamation of Latin America and the Caribbean as a Zone of Peace, signed in Havana by the Heads of State and Government of our region in January 2014, during the third Summit of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, establishes principles and rules for coexistence, cooperation and respect among States that are indispensable for the realization of the right to peace and applicable to relations within our America and its relations with the hemisphere and the world.\\nWe welcome the historic General Agreement for the Termination of the Conflict and the Construction of a Stable and Lasting Peace, which was reached in Havana on 24 August. We will do our best, always at the request of the parties, to support its implementation.\\nWe will continue to support the Government and the people of Venezuela, the civic-military union and Constitutional President Nicolás Maduro Moros in defence of its sovereignty and self-determination against the imperialist and oligarchic interference that is attempting to destroy the Bolivarian and Chavista revolution to take over Venezuela’s oil reserves and reverse the enormous social achievements that have been attained.\\nWe strongly condemn the parliamentary and judicial coup d’état perpetrated in Brazil against President Dilma Rousseff and express our solidarity with her, the Brazilian people, the Workers’ Party and former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.\\nWe reiterate our conviction that the Puerto Rican people deserve to be free and independent, after more than a century under colonial rule.\\nWe will not renounce any of our revolutionary and anti-imperialist principles, the defence of independence, social justice and peoples’ rights, nor our commitment to cooperate with those in greatest need. Cuban cooperation workers, who work on all continents, will continue to make their contribution, including the 46,000 persons who are currently working in 61 countries fighting for the life and health of human beings.\\nThe Cuban Medical Professional Parole Programme, applied by the United States of America to pursue the political objective of impeding Cuba’s medical cooperation and deprive the recipient countries and Cuba of valuable and highly qualified human resources, is a shameful obstacle. Just over a year has elapsed since the restoration of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States and the reopening of their respective Embassies. Some progress has been achieved in our bilateral relations, particularly in diplomatic relations, dialogue and cooperation in areas of common interest, as evidenced by high-level visits, including a visit by President Obama, and the dozen of agreements signed on subjects that could render benefits to both countries and the entire hemisphere. However, the fact is that the blockade remains in force. It continues to cause serious damage and hardship for the Cuban people and hampers the functioning of our economy and our relations with other countries.\\nExecutive measures adopted by the Government of the United States, although positive, are still insufficient. There are many recent examples of the economic, commercial and financial damage caused by the blockade to Cuba and to third countries. As long as this continues to happen, we will continue to present the draft resolution entitled “Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba” for consideration by the Assembly.\\nWe reiterate the readiness of the Government of Cuba to continue developing a respectful dialogue with the Government of the United States, while knowing that we still have a long way to go if we are to normalize our relations, which means building a model of bilateral relations that is a totally new in terms of our common history that can never be forgotten. For this to be possible some day, it will be essential for the blockade to be lifted. In addition, the territory illegally occupied by the United States Naval Base at Guantánamo, against the will of Cuba, must be returned to us.\\nThe Cuban people, even amid the adverse conditions imposed by the current international scenario and the persistence of the economic, commercial and financial blockade imposed by the United States, continues to be involved in updating the economic and social model that it has decided to implement in a fully sovereign way in order to build an independent, sovereign, socialist, prosperous and sustainable nation.\\n',\n",
       " 'Allow me to reiterate to the Secretary-General Cuba’s support for his work at the helm of the United Nations and as a guarantor and advocate of international peace.\\nI would like to express my deep condolences to the relatives of the deceased and the victims of hurricanes Irma and Maria, as well as our readiness to increase our cooperation, to the extent of our modest possibilities, with the brother peoples and the Governments of Dominica and Antigua and Barbuda, which are small Caribbean islands that suffered terrible devastation, along with the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Saint Martin, Sint Maarten, the Virgin Islands and Anguilla. I call upon the international community to give the highest priority to the situation and to mobilize resources to assist the small Caribbean island States and territories that have suffered such devastation.\\nWe would like to convey Cuba’s warmest feelings of solidarity to the people and the Government of Mexico, particularly the victims and their relatives who were affected by earthquakes, and we reiterate our readiness to assist their people and support their recovery efforts with our modest efforts.\\nWe also want to express our sorrow to the people of the United States, as well as our heartfelt condolences to the relatives of the deceased and to all victims of Hurricane Irma.\\nI speak on behalf of the people of Cuba, who are currently carrying out a colossal effort to recover from the severe damage caused to housing, agriculture, the power system and other services by Hurricane Irma. Despite the all-encompassing preventive measures — including the evacuation of more than 1.7 million people — and the full cooperation of all citizens, we suffered the loss of 10 people.\\nThe grave damage to services, the loss of social and personal goods, and the hardships endured by families that spent many hours without electricity and/or water only strengthened the unity and solidarity of our noble and heroic people. The moving scenes of rescuers saving a girl and returning her to her mother, a little boy picking up a bust of José Martí from the rubble, students helping families they had never met before, soldiers from the Armed Forces and the Ministry of the Interior doing the toughest jobs, and local leaders heading the most difficult tasks have become all too familiar.\\nDuring a visit to the area that suffered the most severe devastation, President Raúl Castro issued an appeal that read:\\n“These have been difficult days for our people, who, in just a few hours, have seen how what was built with great effort could be destroyed by a devastating hurricane. The images received during the past few hours are powerful, as is the spirit of resilience and victory of our people, who come back fighting in the face of every adversity.”\\nOn behalf of the Government and the people of Cuba, l sincerely appreciate the genuine expressions of solidarity and affection expressed by numerous Governments, parliaments, international organizations and representatives of civil society. I would like to convey my profound gratitude for the numerous offers of assistance that we have received.\\nI still have vivid and emotional memories of the imposing presence of Fidel Castro Ruz, Commander-in-Chief of the Cuban Revolution, and the great validity of the ideas he expressed to the General Assembly. On behalf of our people and Government, I would like to express our gratitude for the expressions of respect, affection and admiration that we have received from so many.\\nLast Tuesday, President Donald Trump came here to convince us that he proposes to promote the prosperity of nations and persons. But in the real world the wealth possessed by eight men together is equivalent to the wealth shared by the 3.6 billion human beings who make up the poorest half of humanity. In terms of turnover, 69 of the 100 biggest entities in the world are transnational companies, not States. The turnover of the world’s 10 biggest corporations is higher than the public revenues earned by 180 countries combined. Seven hundred million people live in extreme poverty, and 21 million are victims of forced labour. In 2015, 5.9 million children died of preventable or curable diseases before reaching the age of 5. A total of 758 million adults are still illiterate.\\nEight hundred and fifteen million people suffer from chronic hunger — tens of millions more than in 2015. Two billion are undernourished. Even if the precarious decreasing growth rate of recent years rebounds, 653 million persons will continue to face hunger by the year 2030. Given current trends, we will not be able to eradicate hunger by the year 2050.\\nThere are 22.5 million refugees. Humanitarian tragedies associated with migrant flows are worsening and increasing amid the clearly unjust current international economic and political order. The construction of walls and barriers, as well as the laws and measures adopted to prevent the waves of refugees and migrants, have proved to be cruel and ineffective. There is a proliferation of exclusive and xenophobic policies that violate the human rights of millions of people and fail to solve the problems of underdevelopment, poverty and armed conflicts — the main causes of migration and refugee claims.\\nMilitary expenditures have increased to $1.7 trillion. That reality contradicts those who claim that there are not enough resources to eradicate poverty. Despite all the rhetoric, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development lacks the means for its implementation, owing to the egoism and lack of political will of the United States and other industrialized countries.\\nWhat is the miraculous solution that President Donald Trump recommends to us in the absence of the financial flows of the Marshall Plan? Who will contribute the resources for that? How can that be reconciled with the “America First” idea advanced by President Reagan decades ago and by Trump today? The President of the United States ignores and distorts history and believes that a chimera is a goal to be pursued. The production and consumption patterns of capitalism are unsustainable and irrational and will inexorably lead to the destruction of the environment and the end of the human species.\\nCan anyone forget about the consequences of colonialism, slavery, neocolonialism and imperialism? Could the several decades of bloody military dictatorships in Latin America be referred to as an example of successful capitalism? Does anyone know of any form of neoliberal capitalism that has benefited\\n17-29716 5/28 us all, as opposed to that which destroyed the Latin American economies in the 1980s?\\nIt is urgent and essential for the United Nations to work to establish a new participatory, democratic, equitable and inclusive international economic order, as well as a new financial architecture. They must take into account the needs and particularities of developing countries and the asymmetries that exist in world trade and finance as a result of centuries of exploitation and plundering. Industrialized countries have the moral obligation, the historical responsibility and sufficient financial and technological means to do that.\\nHowever, not even the rich will be able to enjoy the forecast prosperity if climate change is not stopped. Cuba regrets the decision taken by the Government of the United States, which has historically been the principal greenhouse-gas-emitting country on the planet, to withdraw that country from the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. In 2016, and for the third consecutive year, the records for the average global temperature increase have been broken, which confirms that climate change is a threat to the survival of humankind and the sustainable development of our peoples. We reiterate our solidarity with the small island developing States, especially those in the Caribbean and the Pacific, which are the most affected by climate change and for whom we request just, special and differentiated treatment. We also support the priority attention accorded to the needs of sub-Saharan Africa.\\nThe United States Government has come here to tell us that, in addition to prosperity, the other two “beautiful pillars” of the international order are sovereignty and security. We all share the common responsibility of preserving the existence of human beings in the face of nuclear weapons. An important contribution to the achievement of that goal was the historic adoption and signing, under the auspices of the Assembly, of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which bans the existence, use and threat of use of such weapons, which have the capacity to annihilate the human species.\\nThe United States has strongly opposed that treaty. It announced that it will invest $700 billion in military expenditures, and it is developing an extremely aggressive nuclear and military doctrine, based on the threat of the use of force and the use of force. NATO member States have violated international peace and security and international law by promoting military interventions and unconventional wars against sovereign States. As the Commander-in-Chief of the Cuban Revolution, Fidel Castro Ruz, pointed out:\\n“When this philosophy of despoilment disappears, the philosophy of war will have disappeared” (A/PV.872, para. 188).\\nThe unlawful imposition of unilateral coercive measures and the use of financial, judicial, cultural and communication tools to destabilize Governments and deny peoples their right to self-determination have become commonplace. I believe that the militarization and the covert use of information and communication technologies to attack other States have increased, while several developed countries strongly oppose the adoption of international treaties that would regulate cooperation aimed at securing a safe cyberspace.\\nThe President of the United States manipulates the concepts of sovereignty and security to his exclusive benefit and to the detriment of all others, including his allies. The attempt to resort to military threat and force in order to stop the irreversible global trend towards multipolarization and polycentrism will seriously jeopardize international peace and security, which should be defended and preserved through international efforts. The principles of sovereign equality, respect for the territorial integrity of States and non-interference in their internal affairs should be respected. The Charter of the United Nations and international law do not allow for reinterpretation.\\nUnited Nations reform should pursue the principal goal of responding to the pressing needs of people and the great disadvantaged majority. Multilateralism should be protected and reinforced so as to resist the imperial interests of domination and hegemony. The democratization of the Security Council, both in terms of its composition and its working methods, is a most urgent task. It is also essential to strengthen the General Assembly and recover the functions that have been usurped.\\nPatriotism, which was invoked in the statement of the United States, is a perversion of humanism and of love and loyalty to the homeland and the enrichment and defence of national and universal culture. It embodies an exceptionalist and supremacist vision of ignorant intolerance in the face of diverse political, economic, social and cultural models.\\nIn developed countries, the loss of the legitimacy of political systems and parties has worsened, and voter abstention is on the rise. Legal and illegal corruption is spreading. There is the extreme case of the so-called special interests, or corporate payments, in exchange for benefits, in the country that spends the highest amount of money in electoral campaigns and where, paradoxically, a candidate with the lowest number of popular votes can be elected or be entitled to govern with the negligible support of voters.\\nThere has been an increasing and unheard-of use of science and technology to exercise hegemony, mutilate national cultures and manipulate human behaviour, as in the case of so-called big data, or psychometry, used for political and advertising purposes. Seven Western consortiums keep strict control over what is being read, seen or heard on the planet. Technologies are being monopolized. The governance of digital networks is dictatorial and discriminatory, and despite appearances the digital divide between rich and poor countries is increasing. Opportunities and the rights of youth, migrants and workers are being curtailed, and their human rights are being openly and systematically violated.\\nThe day before yesterday, the United States Vice-President, Michael Pence, ridiculously ignorant of the functions of the Security Council and attempting to establish new prerogatives, said that the Security Council should modify the composition and methods of the Human Rights Council, which “does not deserve its name” because “a clear majority of the Human Rights Council’s members fail to meet even the most basic human rights standards”.\\nI assume that Mr. Pence is not including his own country in that category, which in fact deserves to be included because of its pattern of the systematic violations of human rights, such as the use of torture, arbitrary detentions and imprisonment, as occurs in the Guantanamo naval base, the assassination of African Americans by law-enforcement agents, the killing of innocent civilians by its troops, xenophobia and repression against immigrants, including minors, and its limited compliance with international instruments.\\nWe reaffirm our strongest condemnation of all forms and manifestations of terrorism, and we reject the application of double standards in combating them.\\nThe urgent quest for a just and lasting solution to the conflict in the Middle East is based on the exercise of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to the existence of a free and independent State within the pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.\\nThe situation in the Western Sahara requires an effort, in accordance with United Nations resolutions, to ensure the Saharan people’s ability to exercise self- determination and to ensure respect for their legitimate right to live in peace in their own territory.\\nCuba reaffirms its support for the quest for a peaceful and negotiated solution to the war in Syria, without any foreign interference and with full respect for its sovereignty and territorial integrity.\\nThreats to international peace and security stemming from the expansion of NATO’s presence along the borders of Russia are on the rise. We continue to reject the unilateral and unjust sanctions imposed against that country.\\nWe demand respect for the so-called nuclear agreement signed with the Islamic Republic of Iran.\\nWe reject the threat to totally destroy the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, home to 25 million human beings. War is not an option on the Korean peninsula; it would threaten the existence of hundreds of millions of people in that area and in neighbouring countries, and it would lead to a nuclear conflagration of unpredictable consequences. Only through dialogue and negotiations will it be possible to achieve a lasting political solution, which should take into account the legitimate concerns of all parties involved. We support the total denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, without foreign interference, with full respect for the sovereign equality and territorial integrity of the States concerned and strict adherence to the principle of the non-use or threat of use of force.\\nToday, new threats are looming over peace and stability in Latin America and the Caribbean, in open disrespect for the Proclamation of Latin America and the Caribbean as a Zone of Peace, signed in Havana by the Heads of State and Government of our region in January 2014 at the Second Summit of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States.\\nWe reiterate the statement made on 14 July by President Raúl Modesto Castro Ruz concerning the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela:\\n“The aggression and putschist violence against Venezuela harms all of ‘Our America’ and only serves the interests of those set on dividing us in order to exercise their control over our peoples, unconcerned about causing conflicts of incalculable consequence in our region, such as those we are seeing in various parts of the world.\\n“Today, we have warned that those attempting to overthrow the Bolivarian and Chavista revolution through unconstitutional, violent and putschist methods will shoulder a serious responsibility in the eyes of history.”\\nWe strongly reject the military threats against Venezuela, including the United States executive order that designates Venezuela a threat to the national security of the United States, and the unilateral, unjust and arbitrary sanctions applied against it.\\nWe reiterate our unwavering solidarity with the Bolivarian and Chavista people and Government, and with its civic-military union led by Constitutional President Nicolás Maduro Moros. We denounce and condemn the Nicaraguan Investment Conditionality Act initiative promoted in the United States Congress as part of an interventionist approach intended to impose an economic embargo against the people and the Government of Nicaragua, to whom we reiterate our support.\\nWe express our solidarity with former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, victim of political persecution intended to prevent him, by means of judicial disqualification, from running for direct elections. Lula, President Dilma Rousseff, the Workers’ Party and the Brazilian people will always find Cuba on their side.\\nWe reaffirm our historic commitment to the free determination and independence of the people of Puerto Rico.\\nWe support the legitimate claim of Argentina for sovereignty over the Malvinas and the South Sandwich and South Georgia Islands.\\nCuba will continue to contribute to the extent possible, and at the request of the parties involved, to efforts to achieve a stable and lasting peace in Colombia.\\nWe will uphold our commitment to share our modest achievements with the peoples of the South, including the efforts of the 40,000 aid workers deployed in 64 countries, who are fighting today for the life and health of human beings.\\nOn 16 June, the President of the United States, Mr. Donald Trump, announced the new Cuba policy of his Administration, which represents a setback in bilateral relations and undermines the basis established two years ago for a move towards a new type of relationship between our two countries that was characterized by respect and equality. The United States Government has decided to tighten the economic, commercial and financial embargo by imposing new obstacles to the already limited possibilities that the United States business community has to trade with and invest in Cuba as well as additional restrictions on United States citizens wishing to travel to our country.\\nThose decisions have ignored the support on the part of broad sectors in the United States, including the majority of Cuban émigrés, for the lifting of the blockade and the normalization of relations. They only serve the interests of a group of individuals of Cuban origin based in south Florida, which is an increasingly isolated minority group that insists on harming Cuba and its people for having decided to defend, at all costs, its right to be free, independent and sovereign. Today, we reiterate our condemnation of the measures aimed at tightening the blockade and reaffirm that any strategy intended to destroy the Cuban Revolution will fail. Likewise, we reject the manipulation of the human rights issue against Cuba, which has much to be proud of and has no need for lessons from the United States or from anyone else.\\nWe wish to express our strongest condemnation of the disrespectful, offensive and interventionist statement against Cuba and the Cuban Government made three days ago from this rostrum by President Donald Trump. We remind him that the United States, where flagrant human rights violations raising deep concerns in the international community are being committed, does not have the slightest moral authority to judge my country. We reaffirm that Cuba will never accept any preconditions or impositions, nor will it ever renounce any of its principles.\\nWith regard to the alleged incidents that have allegedly affected United States diplomatic officials in Havana, we categorically affirm that the Cuban Government rigorously and seriously abides by its obligations under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations to ensure the protection and integrity of all diplomats without exception, including those of the United States, and that Cuba has never perpetrated nor will it ever perpetrate actions of that sort, nor has it allowed nor will it ever allow its territory to be used by third parties for such purposes.\\nBased on the preliminary results of the investigation, carried out with priority and with a high technical component, following instructions issued from the highest level of our Government, the Cuban authorities, having taken into account data provided by United States authorities, have not found any evidence whatsoever that could confirm the cause or the origin of the health disorders referred by United States diplomats and their families. The investigation seeking to clarify that issue is ongoing, and in order to be able to reach a conclusion, it will be crucial to able to count on the cooperation of the United States authorities. It would be unfortunate if a matter of that nature were to become politicized.\\nAs has been expressed by Cuban President Raúl Castro Ruz, Cuba is willing to continue negotiating all pending bilateral issues with the United States, on the basis of equality and absolute respect for the sovereignty and independence of our country. We will maintain a respectful dialogue and cooperation in areas of common interest with the United States Government. Cuba and the United States can cooperate and coexist, respecting our differences and promoting everything that benefits both countries and peoples, but no one should expect Cuba to make concessions that affect its sovereignty and independence.\\nThe Cuban people will not cease their demand for the lifting and total elimination of the economic, commercial and financial blockade and will continue to denounce the strengthening of that policy. On November 1, Cuba will once again present to the General Assembly the annual draft resolution entitled “Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba”.\\nWhile inequality — the opulence of a few and the marginalization of many — is growing in today’s world, the Cuban people will keep up its struggle to achieve the most just society possible. We will continue to steadily advance down the path of revolutionary transformation that has been sovereignly chosen by all Cubans to further improve our socialism.',\n",
       " 'In his first statement at the United Nations in October 1992, the President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, endorsed the concept of preventive diplomacy, an idea that is now a very high priority for the Secretary-General and the President of the General Assembly. That concept has been instrumental for Kazakhstan, which for the 25 years of its independent development has shown itself to be a proactive and responsible member of the international community. My country has become a net contributor to peace, security and stability, and economic and social development, not only in our region but far beyond. We have worked diligently to preserve peace and harmony in our multi-ethnic, multi-religious society, while stressing and ensuring the equality and dignity of every citizen. We have achieved that while also creating an efficient economic model. Our economy has grown 20 times over, and major international corporations have established and strengthened their presence in Kazakhstan, investing more than $265 billion. This year the Institute for Management Development ranked Kazakhstan thirty-second in world competitiveness, after a remarkable rise of 15 places, and thirty-fifth on its ease-of-doing-business index, 16 places higher.\\nLooking forward, Kazakhstan has a clear vision for its future development. We are aiming to become one of the top 30 most competitive economies in the world by 2050, meeting the most advanced global standards in terms of economic performance and transparent governance, especially those of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. A new model of economic growth, Kazakhstan’s third modernization, announced by President Nazarbayev in his annual address earlier this year, outlines a path by which our country can achieve those ambitious goals. On the economic front, the third modernization strongly emphasizes Kazakhstan’s rapid technological modernization, with a focus on new high-tech industries, information and communication technologies, as well as massive improvements in the business environment, economic productivity, human development and institutional reforms. We have committed resources to streamlining and upgrading our road, rail, airport and pipeline infrastructure and ensured the effective joining of Kazakhstan’s national Nurly Zhol programme and China’s One Belt, One Road initiative.\\nThis year, with a view to building a more efficient, sustainable and modern system of governance, President Nazarbayev initiated constitutional reform in Kazakhstan. The reform, now well under way, is aimed at a major redistribution of powers among its three branches and at further democratizing the political system as a whole. The key steps are the transfer of some presidential powers to Parliament and the Government, and the strengthening of a genuine system of checks and balances. Those economic and political modernization processes will be accompanied by efforts in our quest to modernize Kazakhstan’s national identity and cultural code to create conditions for a new generation of competitive and pragmatic citizens and leaders with a thirst for knowledge, progressive consciousness and an open attitude.\\nWe are pleased to see that the expanded regional partnership among Central Asian States has enhanced our common capability to withstand threats and challenges. With that in mind, during our current membership of the Security Council, we have been focusing on creating a model of a regional zone of peace, security, development and cooperation in Central Asia. We are also striving to further strengthen regional cooperation and integration among the brother nations of Central Asia in such areas as water management, trade and development, transportation and many others. Kazakhstan is focusing in particular on regional cooperation aimed at tackling the disastrous situation of the Aral Sea. The International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea is still the only permanent platform for dialogue among Central Asia’s Heads of State, and we believe that it could be used to combine our efforts to formulate mid- and long-term strategies for regional development.\\nThe agenda of the General Assembly at its current session focuses on people, encompassing issues of sustainable development and peace and security, and stresses our common responsibility for the future. None of us can ignore the tough realities we see on the ground — the lack of trust and unity, global and regional inequality and injustice, poverty, xenophobia, conflict, terrorism and extremism, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. That is why this agenda truly reflects the magnitude of the challenges that the United Nations is facing today and at the same time underlines the Organization’s undiminished importance.\\nWhile the United Nations machinery has indeed been subject to criticism and demands for long-awaited reforms aimed at enhancing its preparedness for crises and response capabilities, the Organization remains a beacon of hope for billions of people across the globe, a universal institution that holds a promise of a better, safer and more sustainable life. We believe that the Secretary-General is on the right track in that regard in his efforts to unite Member States in revitalizing the United Nations. We also support the special meeting on United Nations reform convened on 18 September by United States President Donald Trump, which we believe will be a fresh incentive to turn our Organization into an effective and efficient tool that serves the whole of humankind.\\nKazakhstan is actively working on establishing and hosting a United Nations regional hub in Almaty for multilateral diplomacy, with a focus on sustainable development, humanitarian assistance, disaster risk- reduction and resilience-building in the region and beyond. The initiative is in line with the Secretary- General’s idea of optimizing the service-delivery of the United Nations and increasing the effectiveness of United Nations field missions’ activities through proper planning and management.\\nMy country has continued to pursue the concept of a security and development nexus, while reflecting the intrinsic interdependence of peace, security and development. Sustainable development is unimaginable without peace, and vice versa. When our security architecture is eroded, along with regional confrontations and international terrorism it undermines the achievements that we havemade within the framework of the Millennium Development Goals and puts our ability to attain the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in jeopardy. Peace is an integral requirement for social, economic and environmental progress.\\nWhen we speak of opportunities made possible by global modernization, we must bear in mind the dangers that can prevent all of us from realizing our potential. In our interdependent and connected world, nuclear weapons are no longer an asset, but rather a danger. With moral authority and responsibility based on my nation’s bitter experience of hundreds of nuclear tests, my President has stated that eliminating the danger of nuclear weapons is the most urgent task facing humankind in the twenty-first century. That will involve a whole range of important and urgent steps — a complete ban on nuclear testing, the total prohibition of nuclear weapons and the complete and verifiable destruction of nuclear arsenals.\\nWe are deeply concerned about the nuclear tests being conducted by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea — the only State in the twenty-first century that has continued with such tests, despite the condemnation of the entire international community. I want to stress that the actions that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is taking to further develop its nuclear and missile programmes are totally unacceptable. Pyongyang must take serious steps to restore our trust and must recommit to a much-needed political settlement.\\nIn 2009, the General Assembly unanimously adopted resolution 64/35, thereby designating 29 August — the day the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site was officially closed in 1991 by the decree of President Nazarbayev — as the International Day against Nuclear Tests. That day has been widely commemorated in Kazakhstan and in the United Nations since 2010. This year has also been marked by several events of international significance. From 25 to 29 August, Astana hosted the conference of the Pugwash movement of scientists commemorating the movement’s sixtieth anniversary and the International Day against Nuclear Tests, at which hundreds of scholars, practitioners and officials from some 50 countries gathered to seek ways to achieve a nuclear-weapon-free world.\\nOn that same day, my President and Director General Yukiya Amano, of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), opened the IAEA Low- Enriched Uranium Bank facility in Kazakhstan, with a view to making a significant contribution to the uses of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and strengthening the global non-proliferation regime. At the opening ceremony, President Nazarbayev outlined a number of important initiatives that I would like to share with the Assembly.\\nThe first will be to convene a summit of all the States that possess nuclear weapons to collectively discuss further steps towards their nuclear disarmament and the attainment of a nuclear-weapon-free world. The second is to enhance the role of nuclear-weapon-free zones as effective instruments for ending further nuclear proliferation and to combine the efforts of States members of such zones at a meeting in our capital of Astana of representatives of all the nuclear- weapon-free zones. The third is to revive the global nuclear-security summit process and to host the first relaunched nuclear-security summit, also in Astana. The fourth is to call for joint efforts to ensure that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is implemented by 2020, which will be the fiftieth anniversary of the Treaty’s entry into force.\\nWe must improve the coordination of our common response to the barbaric acts of terrorists. Kazakhstan fully supports the efforts of the United Nations in that regard, especially the creation of the Office of Counter- Terrorism, with a view to developing a comprehensive long-term approach. That is in line with the President of Kazakhstan’s 2015 proposal for the joint establishment of a global anti-terrorism coalition. My country looks forward to actively and constructively participating in the first-ever meeting of the heads of national counter- terrorism agencies next year with a view to forging a new international counter-terrorism partnership. As a practical contribution to the global partnership in the fight against terrorism, my country has begun to formulate a code of conduct for the achievement of a terrorism-free world as one way to expedite work on a comprehensive convention on international terrorism. We are also committed to implementing the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and have recently allocated $300,000 for its implementation in Central Asia.\\nKazakhstan advocates for the broadest possible implementation of multilateral mechanisms and instruments for combating foreign terrorist fighters and shutting down the channels of financial support for their activities through the illegal trade in drugs, natural resources and cultural artefacts. Since there is a wide range of approaches to the issue of controlling Internet content, we believe that the United Nations should take concerted action to prevent the use of the Internet for recruiting and spreading terrorist ideology and radicalizing populations, especially young people. We in Kazakhstan are working on creating a national cybershield system.\\nThe unspeakable suffering of millions of people in Syria, Iraq, Libya and Yemen, and the ongoing humanitarian crises and gross violations of human rights in those countries, leave none of us indifferent. Kazakhstan is hosting the Astana process on Syria in order to contribute to the peaceful settlement of the situation there and to promote the United Nations-led negotiations in Geneva, which is the primary forum for those negotiations. We believe that the Astana process, which began earlier this year with the support and direct involvement of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, has produced clear, positive results aimed at strengthening the ceasefire regime, creating de-escalation zones and developing a monitoring mechanism. Success in the Geneva and Astana platforms is critical and should be supported by all if we are to save innocent lives in Syria. It is a moral imperative for all of us.\\nKazakhstan has a clear and consistent position on the Middle East peace process, based on a two- State solution approach. We support a sovereign, independent, viable and united State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital, living within secure and recognized borders, side by side in peace with Israel.\\nAs an active member of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), my country, along with other OIC member States, is a firm defender of the ideal of dialogue among nations and peoples of diverse religious identity. In Astana we recently hosted the OIC Summit on Science and Technology on the margins of the International Exhibition Expo 2017. While the Summit was devoted to science and technology matters, the participants were not in a position to ignore the current suffering of the Rohingya community. The OIC member States condemned those continued violations and called for dialogue among the United Nations, the OIC and the Government of Myanmar to stop the humanitarian crisis. Those events have once again highlighted the relevance of our initiative in establishing the Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions.\\nKazakhstan is fully committed to strengthening and improving United Nations peacekeeping activities. We believe that the Secretary-General’s new approach to peacekeeping reform, with a cross-pillar approach focusing on prevention and sustaining peace, will improve the effectiveness and accountability of peacekeeping operations. We are confident that, if we ensure flexibility and partnerships, they will not only encourage the active involvement and engagement of new countries but could also increase the effectiveness of peace operations. My country is committed to increasing its contribution to United Nations peacekeeping by sending more military observers and staff officers to United Nations missions. We recently declared that we had reached the second level of peacekeeping-unit preparedness for deployment to United Nations peacekeeping missions in the United Nations Peacekeeping Capability Readiness System.\\nEarlier this year I presented President Nazarbayev’s policy address to the Security Council. Its seven priorities call for ensuring humankind’s survival through a world free of nuclear weapons by 2045 and through the prevention and elimination of military confrontation at the regional and global levels, thereby generating a model for a regional zone of peace, security, cooperation and development in Central Asia. It calls for all stakeholders to work globally to combat international terrorism and extremism, promote peace and security in Africa, implement the SDGs and work for reform of the Security Council and the United Nations system.\\nKazakhstan will hold the presidency of the Council for the month of January 2018. The major event we are planning during that period will be a high-level open debate on global peace and security. I would like to take this opportunity to extend our invitation to all Member States to participate in the debate at the highest level. Our presidency will focus particularly on security and stability in Afghanistan and Central Asia through the prism of Afghanistan’s peaceful integration, economically and politically, into regional and global processes.\\nMy country remains deeply committed to sustainable development. In the face of the reality of climate change, Kazakhstan, despite its abundant conventional energy resources, is committed to achieving a green economy by diversifying and developing alternative energy sources. That led us to choose “Future energy” as the theme for the Astana Expo 2017 international exhibition. Throughout the summer, 115 countries and 22 international organizations, including the United Nations, its funds, agencies and programmes, showcased their creative experiences. That enormous undertaking is clear evidence of Kazakhstan’s pledge to carry forward the Paris Climate Change Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. One of the best ways to promote a green economy and green business is the use of the legacy of the Expo infrastructure. With the support of five United Nations agencies, we are establishing a “Future energy” international centre for the development of green technologies and investment projects. Its activities will be in full compliance with Kazakhstan’s Green Bridge Partnership Programme, as reflected in the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. The Expo infrastructure will also house an Astana international financial centre and a centre for information-technology start-ups. We invite all Member States to participate in their activities.\\nAs I mentioned earlier, we hosted the first-ever OIC Summit on Science and Technology within the framework of the Expo, an event that underlined the importance of technological modernization in achieving unity and solidarity in the 1.5-billion-strong Islamic world. The high-level meeting, which was attended by 15 presidents and dignitaries from 57 States, emphasized the clear and undeniable link between security and development and recognized that building a sustainable future for our nations is the only way to end challenges and threats to their security. In support of the OIC’s endeavours, the President of Kazakhstan proposed creating a 15-member OIC forum, similar to the Group of 20, designed to streamline our scientific and economic cooperation. He invited Islamic nations to jointly develop the Expo legacy in the areas of Islamic finance and green technologies, and established a prize for Islamic science and innovations.\\nIn conclusion, I would like to stress how vital it is that we preserve peace and stability and ensure the gradual and sustainable development of our fragile world. We do not have the luxury of being able to make mistakes and then going back to correct them. We call on all world leaders to redouble their efforts and their goodwill with the goal of making progress towards lasting peace and prosperity for all.',\n",
       " 'It gives me great pleasure to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Miroslav Lajčák on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. We wish him every success in his mandate. I also wish to express my appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson for his valuable efforts in managing the affairs of the General Assembly during the seventy-first session. I also take this opportunity to commend the efforts of His Excellency Secretary-General António Guterres to strengthen the role of the United Nations.\\nMaintaining regional and international peace and security is a priority in the foreign policy of the State of Qatar, which bases its principles and objectives on the Charter of the United Nations and the rules of international law. It calls for constructive cooperation among States, mutual respect and non-interference in internal affairs, as well as good-neighbourliness and the promotion of peaceful coexistence, while pursuing peaceful means to settle disputes.\\nThe issue of settling disputes by peaceful means is still being addressed as an episodic and non-binding proposal. Perhaps the time has come to impose dialogue and negotiation as a basis for resolving disputes by concluding an international convention on settling disputes between States by peaceful means.\\nIn that context, and after major events such as the Second World War, Rwanda and Burundi and the Balkan conflicts in the past century, the danger of the impunity of perpetrators of crimes against humanity and crimes of genocide has returned to threaten humankind by becoming the rule rather than the exception, because international legitimacy is subjected to political pressure, the interests of parties and the dictation of force on the ground, which maintain that the law of force is able to supersede the force of law.\\nIn our view, major Powers should not range between two extremes: the direct occupation of countries to impose the occupier’s will and policy, or standing idly by as an observer who does nothing with regard to wars of genocide and crimes against humanity perpetrated by fascist, despotic regimes, or to continuous repression by an occupying State of the people under occupation.\\nLately there has been a growing sense that people under repression face their fate alone, as if the international arena were governed by the law of the jungle and the countries under threat had to stand on their own through help from their alliances and relations, in the absence of a system to implement the provisions of international law and binding conventions and charters.\\nWe commend the President for the theme chosen for this session, that is, “Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet”. In that context, I call upon the Government of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar and the international community to assume their legal and moral responsibility and take the measures necessary to stop the violence against the Rohingya minority, provide them with protection, repatriate the displaced to their homeland, prevent sectarian or ethnic discrimination against them and ensure that they have their full legitimate rights as full-fledged citizens. We urge all States to provide humanitarian assistance to the Rohingya.\\nEvery time I stand here, I speak in favour of constructive international cooperation, just peace and the rights of peoples under occupation, those who are subjected to crimes against humanity and those who are under siege. This time I stand here while my country and my people are subjected to a continuing and unjust blockade, imposed since 5 June by our neighbouring countries. The blockade involves all aspects of life, including intervention by those countries to sever family ties. At the moment Qatar is successfully managing its life — its economy, development plans and its outreach to the wider world — thanks to sea and air routes that those countries do not control.\\nThe blockade was imposed abruptly and without warning, prompting Qataris to consider it as a kind of betrayal. It seems that those who planned and implemented it had envisaged that their action would cause a shocking and direct impact that would bring the State of Qatar to its knees and cause it to capitulate to a total guardianship imposed upon it.\\nWhat is worse, those who schemed for the blockade found it necessary to rely on fabricated quotes attributed to me, which they posted on the Qatar News Agency website after hacking it. The controlled media of those countries were ready to launch an all-out campaign of incitement, prepared in advance, in which all values, morals and norms were breached, while a torrent of lies infringed upon the truth. Funds are still being spent unsparingly on the machine faking news and disseminating fabrications in the hope of fooling people by distorting the truth with plain lies.\\nDespite the exposure of the hacking and falsification of quotes by the Amir of a sovereign State, the blockading countries did not back down or apologize for lying, but rather intensified their campaign, in the hope that the blockade would cause a cumulative effect on the economy and the society of my country, after it failed to have any direct impact. The perpetrators of the hacking and the falsified quotes have committed an assault against a sovereign State. The crime was deliberately committed for political aims and was followed by a list of political declarations, which contravene sovereignty. They caused worldwide astonishment.\\nThis disgraceful act has once again raised international questions about digital security, cybercrime and electronic piracy. It has also revealed the anxiety in many public and official circles around the world over the absence of clear-cut international legislation and institutions to govern this dangerous and vital field, or to punish the perpetrators of transnational crimes. It is high time to take steps in this regard. We are ready to mobilize our potential to serve in such a joint effort.\\nThe countries that imposed the unjust blockade on Qatar have intervened in the internal affairs of the State by putting pressure on the citizens through food, medicine and family ties, with a view to forcing them to change their political affiliation so as to destabilize a sovereign country. Is this not one of the definitions of terrorism?\\nThis illegal blockade was not confined to the economic field and to breaching the World Trade Organization agreement, but went beyond that to violate human rights conventions by arbitrary measures that have caused social and religious harm to thousands of citizens and residents of the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council by violating the basic human rights to work, education and the freedom of movement and the right to private property.\\nHowever, things did not stop at that point, as the blockading countries went on to persecute their own citizens on their own territories and to impose penalties of imprisonment and fines on them for the mere expression of their sympathy with the State of Qatar, even on social media. That was unprecedented, and it violates the human rights conventions and agreements that guarantee the right to the freedom of opinion and expression.\\nThere are countries that not only attack a neighbouring country so as to dictate its foreign policy and media policy, but also believe that having a lot of money qualifies them to put pressure on other countries and blackmail them to participate in their aggression, while they are supposed to be held accountable internationally for what they have committed.\\nThe countries that imposed the blockade on the State of Qatar are interfering in the internal affairs of many countries and accuse all those who oppose them, domestically or abroad, of terrorism. Thus they are harming the war on terror, while at the same time opposing reform and supporting the tyrannical regimes in our region, in whose prisons terrorists are born.\\nWe were not alone in being taken by surprise by the imposition of the blockade, as many countries whose leaders have questioned its motives and reasons were also surprised. The blockading countries have promised all those who asked them about the reasons for the blockade to provide them with evidence of their absurd anti-Qatar allegations and fabrications, which keep changing according to the identity of the person being asked. Everyone is still waiting for evidence, which has not arrived and will not arrive — because it does not exist. On the contrary, those allegations contradict the considerable evidence about Qatar’s contribution to the fight against terrorism, which is recognized by the entire international community.\\nThe State of Qatar has fought terrorism, and the entire international community bears witness to that.\\nIt is still fighting terrorism and will continue to do so. It stands in the camp of those who are fighting by security means and believes that it is necessary to fight terrorism ideologically as well. Qatar goes beyond that to participate in drying up its sources by providing education to 7 million children around the world, so that they do not fall prey to ignorance and radical ideas.\\nWe have refused to yield to dictation by pressure and blockade, and our people will not be satisfied with anything less. At the same time, we have taken an open attitude towards dialogue without dictation and have expressed our readiness to resolve differences through compromises based on common undertakings. Resolving conflicts by peaceful means is one of the priorities of our foreign policy. I renew here the call for an unconditional dialogue based on mutual respect for sovereignty. I highly value the sincere and appreciated mediation that the State of Qatar has supported since the beginning of the crisis, which was initiated by my brother, His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, Amir of the sisterly State of Kuwait. I also thank all the countries that have supported this mediation.\\nAllow me on this occasion to express here my pride in my Qatari people, along with the multinational and multicultural residents of Qatar. The people have withstood the conditions of siege, rejected dictation with resolve and pride, insisted on the independence of Qatar’s sovereign decision and strengthened its unity and solidarity, while maintaining their refined manners and their progress despite the fierceness of the campaign launched against them and their country.\\nI reiterate my thanks to the sisterly and friendly countries that recognize the significance of respecting the sovereignty of States and the rule of international law, while also appreciating their stance of remaining supportive of the Qatari people during this crisis.\\nTerrorism and extremism are among the most serious challenges facing the world. Countering them requires us all to carry out concerted action against terrorist organizations and their extremist ideology, in order to maintain security for humankind and stability for the world. Governments worldwide have no choice but to cooperate in dealing with the threat of terrorism as a security issue, but halting the spread of terrorism and extremism can be achieved by addressing its social, political and cultural root causes. We must also be careful not to use the fight against terrorism as an umbrella to cover reprisals or the shelling of civilians.\\nThe fight against terrorism and extremism was and will continue to be a top priority. That is affirmed by the effective participation of the State of Qatar in regional and international efforts to implement the measures included in the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, adopted in 2006, and all the Security Council resolutions and measures related to countering terrorism and its financing.\\nWe have also participated in international coalitions and regional organizations and nurtured bilateral relations with the United States of America and many countries of the world. The State of Qatar will continue its regional and international efforts in this regard and will develop them further.\\nWhile reaffirming our condemnation of all forms of extremism and terrorism, we reject the tackling of this phenomenon using double standards, according to the identity of the perpetrators, or linking terrorism with a particular religion, race, civilization, culture or society.\\nThe issues facing the Middle East continue to pose the greatest threat to international peace and security due to the vital importance of that region to the world. Israel still stands in the way of achieving a lasting, just and comprehensive peace and rejects the Arab Peace Initiative. The Israeli Government maintains its intransigent approach and strategy to create facts on the ground through expanding settlement construction in the occupied territories, Judaizing Jerusalem and restricting the performance of religious rituals in the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which is a serious, provocative act. It also continues to impose its blockade on the Gaza Strip.\\nThe international community must give high priority to the resumption of peace negotiations on the basis of ending the Israeli occupation of the Arab territories within a specified time frame, and to reaching a just, comprehensive and vital settlement, in accordance with the two-State solution, agreed upon by the international community and based on the resolutions of international legitimacy and the Arab Peace Initiative. A settlement will be achieved only through the establishment of an independent Palestinian State on the basis of the 1967 borders, with Jerusalem as its capital. I renew my appeal to my Palestinian brothers to achieve national reconciliation, consolidate their positions and speak with one voice when confronting the dangers and challenges facing the Palestinian question on the future of the Palestinian people.\\nThe international community is unable to find a solution to the Syrian crisis despite its consequences and serious repercussions for the region and the world. Political efforts continue to falter due to conflicting international and regional interests, which serve to protect those against whom we are supposed to stand united. The international community has relinquished its legal and moral responsibilities, including the implementation of its decisions, and has succumbed to the logic of force. What is required is serious work to reach a political solution to the Syrian crisis in a way that meets the aspirations of the Syrian people to justice, dignity and freedom, and to maintain the unity and sovereignty of Syria, in accordance with the decisions of the Geneva I Conference on Syria. Qatar will spare no effort in providing support and assistance to alleviate the humanitarian suffering of our Syrian brothers and to implement our humanitarian pledges within the framework of the United Nations.\\nThe international community has given up the task of protecting civilians. Will it also hesitate to find war criminals accountable? Their impunity will have dire consequences for the situation in Syria and the region, and would affect the behaviour of future dictatorships towards their peoples in the absence of any deterrent.\\nTurning to the Libyan question, Libya’s national consensus, which would preserve its unity, sovereignty and social fabric and restore its stability, could be achieved by means of combining domestic and international efforts. We must all intensify our efforts and support the Government of National Accord, which has been established with the support of the United Nations, in its effort to restore stability and to counter terrorism and its grave consequences. The State of Qatar has supported international mediation efforts and will support them in future in order to meet the aspirations of the Libyan people.\\nConcerning the fraternal country of Iraq, we support the efforts of the Iraqi Government to achieve security, stability and the unity of the territory and people of Iraq. We commend the achievements of the Iraqi people in their fight against terrorism. We reaffirm our support to promote their victory by helping the people of Iraq to realize their aspirations for equality among all its citizens and to restore Iraq’s role at the regional and international levels.\\nConcerning Yemen, we affirm the importance of maintaining Yemen’s unity, security and stability and ending the state of infighting and war, while adopting dialogue, a political solution and national reconciliation as a basis for ending this crisis and implementing Security Council resolution 2216 (2015). We call on the international community to facilitate the access of humanitarian assistance to various Yemeni regions. The State of Qatar supports the efforts of the United Nations Special Envoy for Yemen to end the crisis and realize the aspirations of the brotherly Yemeni people to attain unity, security and stability.\\nIn order to achieve security and stability in the Gulf region, we reiterate the call that we have made before from this rostrum for a constructive dialogue between the Gulf Cooperation Council countries and Iran on the basis of common interests, the principle of good-neighbourliness, respect for State sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs of other States.\\nIn the framework of international efforts to address humanitarian crises, the State of Qatar continues to contribute to the international response to the growing humanitarian needs of the world at large. We have increased our financial contributions to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) so as to enable the Organization to implement its programmes and provide humanitarian relief to those in need worldwide.\\nThe State of Qatar ranks third on the list of major donors to OCHA in 2017. We continue to provide support to countries facing challenges in implementing their development plans. It is worth mentioning here that the State of Qatar ranked first in the Arab world and 33rd in the world in the field of human development. This proves the effectiveness of our humanitarian and development policy. We look forward to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, which we all have committed to achieve.\\nIn conclusion, we reiterate that the State of Qatar will spare no effort in strengthening the role of the United Nations and and efforts to achieve what the international community seeks, bringing peace and security and promoting human rights and advancing development. Qatar will remain, as is always the case, a safe haven for the oppressed, and we will continue its mediation efforts to find just solutions in conflict zones.',\n",
       " 'In December of last year, the General Assembly adopted resolution 71/190, on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order, which clearly stipulated the inadmissibility of interference in the internal affairs of States and of coups d’état as a method of transferring power, and the importance of excluding from international relations certain States’ efforts to exert unlawful pressure on others, including through the extraterritorial application of national jurisdictions. An overwhelming majority of Member States voted in favour of the resolution. The minority was chiefly represented by the very countries that, contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, are attempting to dominate world affairs and impose their own development models and values on other States and peoples, led by a one-sided logic that undermines international law.\\nBut the world is not standing still. We were pleased that United States President Donald Trump unequivocally stated from this rostrum the day before yesterday that it is important to comply with the principles of sovereignty in international affairs and to lead by example rather than by imposing one’s will on other nations, and that countries with different values, cultures and aspirations can not only coexist but can work side by side on a basis of mutual respect. I believe that we can all subscribe to those words, especially if United States foreign policy will in fact be conducted on that basis.\\nRussia has always abided by the principles of sovereignty, non-interference in the affairs of other States, the equality of peoples and mutual respect in its international dealings, and it will continue to uphold them. In the past quarter century, despite challenges, our country has taken on in good faith its share of the work of eliminating the legacy of the Cold War and has done much to strengthen trust and understanding in Europe, the Atlantic region and all over the world. However, that has not been reciprocated by our Western partners, intoxicated as they were by the illusion of the onset of the end of history, and who are still trying to adapt rudimentary institutions designed for an era of bloc-versus-bloc confrontation to today’s realities. NATO wants to recreate the climate of the Cold War and refuses to implement the principle it solemnly declared in the 1990s — equal and indivisible security throughout the region of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.\\nThe West has built its policies according to the principle of “he who is not with us is against us”, and has proceeded with the heedless expansion of NATO eastwards, fomenting instability in post-Soviet geopolitics and inciting anti-Russian feeling. It is that policy that lies at the root of the protracted conflict in Ukraine. Despite the efforts of the Normandy format and the Trilateral Contact Group, the authorities in Kyiv constantly come up with new ploys to interfere with the implementation of their commitments under the package of measures outlined in the Minsk agreements of 12 February 2015 and endorsed by the Security Council.\\nBut even in those circumstances, Russia has been focused on constructive effort and on finding mutually acceptable ways to implement the Minsk agreements. In response to concerns that have been expressed about the current security situation, President Putin has launched an initiative to establish a United Nations mission to protect the OSCE observers in the Donbas region, and a corresponding draft resolution has been introduced in the Security Council. We believe Russia’s proposal will help to facilitate a settlement of the internal crisis in Ukraine that resulted from the anti-constitutional coup led by ultra-radicals. We hope for constructive interaction on the issues with our European and United States partners, without zero-sum games.\\nHere at United Nations Headquarters, we should bear in mind how the United Nations began. The decisions of the Nuremberg Tribunal were a warning against forgetting the lessons of the Second World War and the disastrous consequences of attempts to take control of the world’s destiny by trampling on the lawful interests of other nations and peoples. It is disgusting to use concerns about freedom of expression as a pretext for condoning radical movements that preach neo-Nazi ideology and support the glorification of Nazis and their associates. We need constant vigilance to maintain a secure shield against neo-Nazism, revanchism, extremism and xenophobia and strengthen international and intercultural harmony.\\nInciting hatred and intolerance, terrorists, extremists and nationalists destroy and desecrate objects of historical, religious and cultural value. Civilized Europe tolerates the demolition of monuments to the liberators of the continent and heroes of the Second World War whose victory was the foundation for the United Nations. We think this issue should be a priority for immediate attention from the General Assembly and UNESCO with a view to establishing a legal framework to prevent such actions, and Russia intends to submit proposals for it. The continuing indifference to the shameful issue of statelessness that persists in Europe is also unacceptable, as is the suppression of minority languages, which is a gross violation of Council of Europe conventions.\\nHistory has shown us throughout the ages that arriving at lasting settlements to disputes is possible only through dialogue and finding a balance between the conflicting parties’ core interests. Unfortunately, outright pressure is replacing diplomacy increasingly often in the arsenals of a number of Western countries. Imposing unilateral sanctions on top of those authorized by the Security Council is an illegitimate act that undermines the collective international effort. Today we have all been watching with alarm as the United States has imposed yet another set of restrictions — in fact, extraterritorial restrictions — on Iran, and threatening the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which has become a key factor in international and regional stability. The United States embargo on Cuba, which has gone on for more than half a century, is a demonstration of the uselessness of policies involving unilateral sanctions, and almost every Member State has been calling for it to be lifted for decades. It is time to listen to them.\\nThe spiralling confrontation around the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is unraveling dangerously. We firmly condemn Pyongyang’s adventurist nuclear- missile manoeuvres, which violate Security Council resolutions. But whipping up military hysteria is not only a blind alley, it is a deadly one. It goes without saying that all Security Council resolutions must be implemented but, along with sanctions, they all include provisions on the importance of resuming talks. We must stop blocking those provisions. There is no alternative to the political and diplomatic route, based on a dialogue among all interested parties, for addressing the Korean peninsula’s nuclear problem. We urge all responsible members of the international community to support the Russian-Chinese road map, as outlined by the Foreign Ministries of Russia and China in a joint statement on 4 July.\\nIncitement to disorder and threats of violent intervention in the cause of the democratization of Venezuela are unacceptable, as is any action aimed at undermining the legitimate Government of any country. In any internal conflict, the international community must encourage the parties to take the path of national reconciliation and compromise. Efforts to ignore the opinions of others and resort to decrees and ultimatums, or to use force to circumvent the Charter of United Nations, have never done any good. The explosion of international terrorism, the millions of refugees and unprecedented waves of illegal migration are to a large degree the result of the attempts of the past few years to achieve regime change, including through the armed interventions that have wreaked havoc and destruction in the Middle East and North Africa and have paved the way for terrorists in parts of the world where they had never appeared before.\\nDespite the fact that the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) is pulling back in Syria and Iraq, considerable additional effort will be needed to stabilize the region. We should recall that we are fighting Al-Nusra as well as ISIL, despite the fact that for some reason Al-Nusra is tolerated by United States coalition members. Recent developments in\\nSyria have given grounds for cautious optimism. The sixth international meeting on Syria, held in Astana on 14 and 15 September, finalized the establishment of the four de-escalation zones, which had been agreed on with the participation of Russia, Iran, Turkey, the United States, Jordan and the United Nations, with the support of many other countries. The agreements create the conditions for further progress towards implementing Security Council resolution 2254 (2015) on the basis of direct dialogue between the Government and the opposition aimed at uniting their efforts to eliminate the terrorist epicentre as soon as possible and restoring peace and unity throughout the country, while resolving its acute humanitarian problems. The most urgent task is to increase the supplies of humanitarian aid and demining the liberated territories. We believe firmly that anyone who sincerely desires peace for Syria and its people should take part in this process under the leadership of the United Nations and without any preconditions. The incidents where chemical weapons have been used in the region are a separate issue. Every case should be investigated honestly and professionally, with no attempts to manipulate the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-United Nations Joint Investigative Mechanism.\\nFinding solutions to humanitarian issues and reconciling conflicting parties are also relevant issues for other crises in the region, including the situations in Libya, Yemen and Iraq. In all of those situations, as with any conflict, Russia is pursuing a balanced policy and working with all parties without exception. With regard to issues in the Middle East and North Africa, we cannot put United Nations decisions on the Palestinian question and the Arab Peace Initiative on the backburner, much less consign them to oblivion. We believe that restoring Palestinian unity is crucial and welcome Egypt’s efforts in that direction. Russia is ready to assist in every possible way with the resumption of direct talks between Israel and Palestine, and to cooperate with its partners in the Quartet and the Arab League of States for that purpose. As long as the Palestinian question goes unresolved, it will continue to be exploited by extremists, who are attracting ever more new recruits.\\nThe never-ending bloody terrorist attacks around the world illustrate the illusory nature of efforts to create isolated safe havens. We can combat extremism and terrorism together, without double standards or hidden agendas, only based on the primary responsibility of States, as envisaged in the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. We welcome the reform of United Nations counter-terrorism activities that the Secretary-General has initiated, which the General Assembly has endorsed. We see the appointment of a Russian to head the new United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism as an acknowledgement of the role that Russia has played in combating this evil, and we thank everyone for their support.\\nRussia is committed to the goal of achieving a nuclear-weapon-free world. Under the existing treaty regimes in the area of arms control and non-proliferation, the complete elimination of nuclear weapons should be the end result of a process of universal and total disarmament that continues to ensure equal and indivisible security. Attempts to outlaw nuclear weapons that ignore current realities and all the factors that can affect strategic stability serve only to make this common goal further off than ever and to undermine the consensus regimes of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\\nWe urge everyone to say no to the militarization of the information space. We must work to stop it becoming an arena for political and military confrontation and prevent the use of information and communications technologies as instruments for exerting pressure, inflicting economic damage and spreading terrorist and extremist propaganda. The United Nations should focus its efforts on formulating rules for responsible behaviour in the digital sphere that can meet the security interests of all States. Russia has drafted a universal convention on countering cybercrime, including hacking, and we hope to launch discussions on it during the current session.\\nIt is clear that in future the world will continue to confront a whole range of new, long-term problems affecting our entire civilization. We have no right to waste our energy, time and efforts on geopolitical games. We need collective approaches, not unilateral ones. The process of shaping a polycentric world order is also a trend — a changing event that reflects the redistribution of the global balance of power and the increasing role that the cultural and civilizational identity of peoples plays in it. All of us, including those who are used to telling the world what to do, will have to adapt to it. It is in our common interests not to try to restrain this natural process. We will have to work to ensure that the world order becomes fair and democratic,\\n26/33 17-29585 just as the founding fathers of the United Nations envisioned. Globalization should unite rather than divide people, while taking account of the interests of all States without exception and contributing to a stable and secure future for all humankind. Without mutual trust, we cannot hope for the effective implementation of the ambitious Sustainable Development Goals or the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, or for solutions to global issues that are so crucial to developing countries, such as food security, demographics and health care.\\nThe fundamental principles of international relations should include the recognition of political pluralism, freedom of choice and the rule of law. We must stop relying on military alliances and instead provide support and security guarantees to States that opt for neutrality. On the economic front, we must work to lower barriers to trade and investment and stop politicizing economic relations. The International Olympic Movement, and sports in general, should remain outside politics. First and foremost, we must foster in young people respect for the cultural and civilizational diversity of today’s world. We invite everybody to the nineteenth World Festival of Youth and Students, which my country will host in Sochi less than a month from now. Another important event will take place in Russia at the same time, when St. Petersburg convenes the 137th Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly, at which the main topic for discussion will be “Promoting cultural pluralism and peace through interfaith and inter-ethnic dialogue”. Let us encourage dialogue among various cultures and religions and stop using historical events to foment hatred and fear.\\nA philosophy of coexistence, unity and harmonization of countries’ different interests underlies President Vladimir Putin’s proposal for a greater Eurasian partnership, open to all States of Asia and Europe, with the goal of creating an economic and humanitarian space based on the principle of the indivisibility of security. It goes without saying that equal rights for all, individuals and States, would be a universal requirement, as stated in the Charter of the United Nations. Those just and equitable principles form the foundation for the activities of various organizations in which Russia actively participates, including the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Collective Security Treaty Organization, the Eurasian Economic Union, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the BRICS group of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. We also continue to build relations with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the African Union, the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States and other associations of Asian, African and Latin American countries. Through our joint efforts we have achieved a more balanced approach in the work of organizations such as the Group of 20, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.\\nWe believe in the vitality of this Organization and would like the Secretary-General to play an active role in facilitating the full realization of its potential based on the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, while respecting the prerogatives of its intergovernmental bodies. Peacekeeping reform in particular requires a carefully tailored approach, without abrupt shifts or abandoning decades of invaluable accumulated experience.\\nTwo thousand years ago, the Roman philosopher Seneca wrote, “We are born to live together”. The founding fathers of the United Nations understood that better than anyone. They believed — and enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations — that our God-given existence on a single planet should compel all of us to unite in order to prevent the scourge of new wars. If we are to do that today, we badly need to revive the culture of diplomacy and dialogue and the quest for a balance of our interests, rather than making rash, instinctive decisions in our desire to punish those who disobey us. What this is really about is preserving humankind in all its richness and diversity. Russia has always been, and always will be, open to working together with all those who show that they are ready to meet halfway and cooperate on a basis of equality and mutual respect. We will continue to uphold those principles in the work of the United Nations in the interests of improving global governance and genuinely democratizating international relations.',\n",
       " 'Every September, global attention is focused on the United Nations and on this stately Assembly Hall. People watch closely what is happening here, hoping that the United Nations will deliver peace, development, harmony  and prosperity to the world. People look to the United Nations to help them realize their dreams for a better life, to a United Nations that is committed to making itself relevant to all people, thereby making our world a better place for everyone to live in.\\nThe contemporary international order, which began with the founding of the United Nations, is based on the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and is enhanced by the vision and practice of multilateralism. It has brought about general peace and rapid development over the past 70 years or more. A\\n \\npeople-centred philosophy has gained wide acceptance, and a broad consensus has formed on the need for interdependence and win-win cooperation.\\nYet it is also true that the international  order today faces problems and needs steady reform and improvement. The world is changing. As we celebrate humankind’s proud achievements and progress, we must never lose sight of the challenges and difficulties we face in an ever-changing world. We must remain vigilant. What we see today is that international rules and multilateral mechanisms are under attack, and the international landscape is filled with uncertainties and destabilizing factors. Should we stay committed to multilateralism or let unilateralism have its way? Should we seek to uphold the architecture of the world order or allow it to be eroded and collapse? Those are critical questions bearing on the future of all countries and the destiny of humankind, questions that all countries must carefully reflect on and seek answers to.\\nChina’s answer is clear cut.  All  along,  China  has upheld the international order and pursued multilateralism. Though once kept out of the United Nations for 22 years, China has never wavered in its commitment to multilateralism and to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. China stayed true to  its  commitment  throughout  the negotiation process on its return to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and then its accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) — negotiations that lasted 15 long years and were concluded at a certain price. China fulfilled its promise and integrated itself into the world economic system. After the international financial crisis broke out, China chose not to stand idly by; instead it worked together with other countries to get through those challenging times. For many years, China has contributed more than 30 per cent of global economic growth. It has played its part in helping with the global recovery. In the face of new developments and severe challenges, China will keep to its commitment and remain a champion of multilateralism.\\nStanding at this rostrum in 2015, Chinese President Xi Jinping, in his statement reflecting the key understanding of humankind’s common interest and the future of  our planet, called for  the building  of a community with a shared future for humankind (seeA/70/PV.13). That initiative is in keeping with the trend of history, and it echoes the call of the times. It adds to our conviction and strength as we pursue our common endeavour to protect this global village. It\\npoints us in the direction where we should work together to open up an even better future for humankind.\\nTo uphold multilateralism in this new era, we believe that the following principles must be adhered to. First, we must pursue win-win cooperation. Our world is undergoing profound changes, never before seen in this century. Also never seen before are the problems and challenges we are facing. No country can meet them alone or stay immune to their impact. We must replace confrontation with cooperation and coercion with consultation. We must remain united as a big family. Instead of forming closed circles, we must promote common development through consultation instead of taking a “winner-takes-all” approach. That is a sure way to usher in a bright future.\\nSecondly, we must act in accordance with rules and order. State-to-State relations must be based on credibility, not the wilful revocation of commitments. International cooperation should be guided by rules, not impulse. Practising multilateralism is, first and foremost, about upholding the Charter of the United Nations, observing international law and basic norms governing international relations, and honouring international agreements reached through negotiations.\\nThirdly, we must uphold the principles of fairness and justice. In international affairs, fairness and justice mean equality among all countries, big or small. They signify the responsibility  of  big  countries  to  help the small, and rich ones to assist the poor. Fairness  and justice also mean respect for other countries’ sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, as well as their choice of  development paths and right to a better life and increased development opportunities.\\nFourthly, we must act to deliver real results. Multilateralism is not based on empty rhetoric. It must be pursued to solve problems. Efforts must be targeted, results-oriented and measured by visible progress. Whether a multilateral mechanism works depends on the will and engagement of countries. It is imperative that we work together to uphold the international system with the United Nations at its core, as well as the multilateral trading system centred on the World Trade Organization. Multilateralism requires a strong United Nations. China supports Secretary-General Guterres in advancing reform of the United Nations system in the three critical areas of peace and security, economic development and internal management. That reform should be led by Member States, and it should prioritize\\n \\nthe concerns of developing countries, make the United Nations more effective and enhance oversight and accountability. Stable and predictable funding is critical to the proper functioning of the United Nations. China will continue to fulfil its financial obligations and calls on other Member States to pay their membership contributions and peacekeeping assessments on time and in full.\\nThe momentum of humankind’s drive forward towards development and progress is unstoppable. Peace, reconciliation and harmony represent the predominant trend, while war, conflict and terror are opposed by all. Equality, mutual trust and win-win cooperation are key words of our times, whereas power politics and the law of the jungle find no support. As a major responsible country, China is committed to the path of peaceful development, and it will work together with other countries and contribute its share to global peace and security.\\nOver the past year, the situation on the Korean peninsula has seen a major turnaround thanks to the efforts of all the parties concerned. China,  for  its part, has contributed to that progress. China supports the comprehensive improvement of relations between the north and the south of the peninsula, as well as efforts to facilitate dialogue between the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and the United States. China encourages the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to continue moving towards denuclearization. We believe that it is also incumbent on the United States to respond in a timely and positive manner so  as to truly meet  the  Democratic  People’s  Republic of Korea halfway. China will continue to honour its international responsibilities and obligations and will strictly implement the Security Council resolutions related to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. China calls on the Security Council to take timely action in the light of developments and changes in the situation so as to create more favourable  conditions for a peaceful settlement of the issue on the peninsula through political and diplomatic means. To effectively settle the issue we need complete denuclearization and the establishment of a peace mechanism. Only when those components move in tandem can the issue be truly resolved and peace achieved.\\nRegarding the Iranian nuclear issue, now is a crucial time for the continued implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The JCPOA is a consensus-based multilateral agreement endorsed\\nby the Security Council. It serves the common interests of all the parties concerned and the international community at large. If it is not implemented, the international nuclear non-proliferation regime  will be undermined, the authority and role of the Security Council challenged, and peace and stability jeopardized both in that region and throughout the world,. That is  a scenario from which no one stands to gain. China urges the parties concerned to continue to observe and implement the JCPOA. On that basis, the possibility could be explored for a platform for dialogue that is inclusive and transparent so as to enable each party’s concerns to be adequately addressed through  talks and consultations.\\nThe question of Palestine must not be marginalized. For more than seven decades, peace and justice have remained elusive in that part of the world. What the international community needs most is not a proposal or an initiative but resolve and action. In order to implement a two-State solution, a new round of peace-promoting efforts must be made with a view to exploring a new mediation mechanism. To that end, China will play its part, and Chinese humanitarian assistance to the Palestinian people will continue.\\nThe issue involving Myanmar’s Rakhine state cannot be resolved overnight, and steady progress must be made through a three-phase process involving a cessation of violence, the return of the displaced persons and economic development. Myanmar and Bangladesh are inseparable neighbours and could well be inseparable partners. Yesterday, at my meeting with colleagues from Myanmar and Bangladesh and in the presence of Secretary-General Guterres, an agreement was reached between Myanmar and Bangladesh on accelerating the return of the first wave of displaced persons. We believe that Myanmar and  Bangladesh are capable of resolving the issue properly through friendly negotiations.\\nChina supports the leading role of the United Nations in coordinating responses to non-traditional security challenges. On the new frontiers of global governance, such as cyberspace and outer space, State sovereignty must be upheld, rules observed and responsibilities honoured. Terrorism, a threat to all societies, can never be justified. Security Council resolutions must be vigorously implemented to counter cyberterrorism, terrorist financing and the spread of radical narratives so as to eliminate the breeding grounds of terrorism.\\n \\nDevelopment is essential for our world today. We need to address both insufficient development and, more importantly, imbalance in development. There  is no one-size-fits-all model. Every country is entitled to explore a particular development path aimed at delivering happiness and security to its people and bringing about a future of confidence and hope for its children. Countries face various questions with regard to development. Such questions could be turned into drivers for reform, and solutions to problems could bring about development. Economic globalization should not be a process whereby some profit and others lose; even less should it result in widening the gap between North and South. It is important that we  adapt to the trend  of economic globalization and ensure that the process is open, inclusive, balanced and mutually beneficial so that it can deliver benefits to  all.  International trade is complementary and mutually beneficial in nature.  It should not be a zero-sum game in which one side gains at the expense of the others, and no one should be allowed to place their own interest above the interest of others. Protectionism will only be self-defeating, and unilateral moves will hurt everyone.\\nWith regard to friction in trade, China stands for  a proper settlement of disagreements based on rules and consensus through dialogue and consultation on an equal footing. China will not be blackmailed or yield to pressure. We have not only taken steps to defend our own legitimate rights and interests but also to uphold the free trade system, international rules and the international order for the benefit of global recovery and the common interests of all countries.\\nThe implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development should be at the top of the agenda of the current session of the General Assembly. We need to incorporate its implementation into Member States’ development strategies and pursue innovation-driven, coordinated, green and open development that benefits all. We need to forge closer partnerships for development and pursue international development cooperation, with the United Nations at its centre and North-South cooperation as the main channel, supplemented by South-South cooperation. To meet the challenges of climate change, it is crucial to achieve sustainable development. China hopes to see the conclusion of the negotiations on the implementation guidelines of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, scheduled for the end of this year, with a view to boosting joint efforts for global ecological conservation.\\nIn pursuing our common cause of humankind’s development and progress, China has worked in partnership with other countries of the international community. This year marks the fortieth anniversary of China’s reform and opening up. Over those 40 years, we have worked hard and forged ahead successfully along a path of socialism with Chinese characteristics. That path has brought fundamental changes to China. In the past 40 years, more than 700 million individuals in the Chinese population have been lifted out of absolute poverty, which accounts for more than 70 per cent of the global totals for the same period. A basic medical insurance system has been set up to cover China’s 1.35 billion people, and a social pension network accessible to more than 900 million people has been fully implemented. China has built approximately 25,000 kilometres of high-speed railway. That accounts for two thirds of the global total and helps elevate global infrastructure construction.  According  to polls conducted by authoritative international polling agencies, China is at the top of global rankings in terms of public satisfaction with its development and public confidence in its future. The path  of  development that China is pursuing has provided the world with opportunities for shared development. Over the past 40 years, China’s foreign trade has averaged an annual growth rate of 14.5 per cent. That has sustained the impetus for global growth and provided the world with a huge Chinese market. We have every  confidence that we will maintain that momentum and continue to realize high-quality development. China will accelerate efforts to build an advanced economic system, which will create greater trade opportunities and an even better investment environment for other countries.\\nChina will not reverse course or  shut  its  doors but will rather open its doors even wider to the world. China will not erect market barriers but will expand access to the Chinese market. Of all of the developing countries in the world, China has been the fastest in terms of opening up at a level unparalleled by others. When it comes to overall tariff reduction, China has accomplished more than it committed to when it joined the WTO. The breadth of China’s openness in services is close to the average level of  developed countries.  In November, China will host the first International Import Expo in Shanghai, which will be yet another major step in opening China’s market. Countries are welcome to participate actively in it.\\n \\nThe Belt and Road Initiative, proposed by President Xi Jinping, is a public good that China is providing for the world. It has grown into the largest platform for international cooperation. It aims to deliver benefits for all through consultations and cooperation. The Initiative is open, transparent and inclusive. It is  based on international rules and laws, and it aims to achieve green, environment-friendly and sustainable development. It is about pursuing common prosperity through greater complementarity among participating countries. By September, more than 130 countries and international organizations will have signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation with China. Next year, China will host the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, and we welcome all parties to attend that event.\\nChina is the largest developing country in the world. Strengthening cooperation and solidarity with other developing countries has been and will continue to be a firm strategic priority in China’s diplomacy. That choice has been determined by what defines China as a country and by the system and values that China upholds. No matter how  much  China has increased  in strength, and regardless of how the international landscape might change, that strategic priority of China will not change.\\nThe United Nations is the primary platform for advocating for and practising multilateralism. We hope that the current session of the General Assembly will be remembered for its part in upholding multilateralism, world peace and development.  We  hope  that  all  of us in the international community will support the United Nations in its efforts to play a central role in international affairs, and we call on people of all countries to work together to build a community with a shared future for humankind.\\n',\n",
       " 'It is impossible to stand here speaking from this rostrum on behalf of Cuba and not recall historic moments before the General Assembly that are among our most cherished memories. Fidel Castro, Ernesto Guevara, Raúl Castro Ruz and the Chancellor of Dignity, Raúl Roa, to mention only the most illustrious, here raised their voices on behalf not only of our people but also of other non-aligned peoples of Latin America and Caribbean, Africa and Asia,  together  with  whom  we have fought for more than half  a  century for  a  fair international order, that is still far from having been achieved.\\nThat failure is absurd but consistent with the irrationality of a world in which the richest 0.7 per cent of the population can claim 46 per cent of all wealth, while the poorest 70 per cent of the population has access to only 2.7 per cent of that wealth, 3.46 billion people survive in poverty, 821 million live in hunger, 758 million are illiterate and 844 million lack basic services, such as drinking water. All these  figures are, of course, prepared and  regularly  manipulated by global organizations, but it seems that they have failed to raise sufficient awareness among the so-called international community.\\nThese facts are not the result  of  socialism,  as  the President of the United States said in this Hall\\n \\nyesterday (see A/73/PV.6). They are consequences of capitalism, especially imperialism and neoliberalism, of the egoism and exclusion inherent to that system, and of an economic, political, social and cultural paradigm that concentrates wealth in the hands of a minority as a significant majority pay the price through exploitation and poverty.\\nCapitalism financed colonialism; gave rise to fascism, terrorism and apartheid; and  spread  war and conflict, violations of the sovereignty or self- determination of peoples, and the repression of workers, minorities, refugees and migrants. Capitalism runs counter to solidarity and democratic participation. The patterns of production and consumption characteristic of capitalism promote plundering and militarism, threaten peace, lead to violations of human rights; and pose the greatest danger to the ecological balance of the planet and the survival of the human race.\\nNo one should mistakenly believe that humankind lacks the material, financial or technological resources to eradicate poverty, hunger, preventable diseases and other scourges. What is missing is political will among the industrialized countries, which have the moral duty, the historical responsibility and abundant resources to solve the most pressing global problems. The truth is that while funding shortfalls are cited as justification for failing to attain the goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development or address the increasing impacts of climate change, $1.74 trillion was wasted on military expenditure in 2017 — the highest figure since the end of the Cold War.\\nClimate change is another unavoidable reality and a question of survival for the human race, especially for small island developing States. Some of its effects are already irreversible. Scientific evidence shows that the average temperature has increased by 1.1°C compared to pre-industrial levels, and that nine out of 10 people living in urban areas breathe polluted air. However, the United States, one of the major polluters, both historically and today, refuses to join the international community in implementing the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. In so doing, it endangers the very lives of future generations and the survival of all species, including humans.\\nFurthermore, as if there were not enough threats to humankind and its dazzling creations, it is a fact that military and nuclear hegemony not only continues but is extending its reach, dashing the hopes of the majority\\nof peoples for general and complete disarmament. Cuba shares this ideal and, as evidence of its commitment to that aim, on 31 January became the fifth State to ratify the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.\\nIt is impossible for the Organization, born of the desire to overcome through dialogue among nations the destruction wrought by an horrific war, to remain silent about the dangers that threaten us all with the exacerbation of local conflicts, wars of aggression disguised as humanitarian intervention, the forceful overthrow  of  sovereign  Governments,   so-called soft coups and interference in other States’ internal affairs — all of which are established behaviours on the part of certain Powers, under a wild range of pretexts.\\nInternational cooperation to promote and protect human rights for all is imperative, but it is manipulated in a discriminatory and selective way in an attempt to dominate, violating the rights of peoples to peace, self- determination and development.\\nCuba rejects the militarization of outer space and cyberspace, as well as the covert and illegal use of information and communication technologies to attack other States.\\nMultilateralism and full respect for the norms and principles of international law to advance towards a democratic, equitable multipolar world are necessary to ensure peaceful coexistence, maintain international peace and security and find lasting solutions to systemic problems.\\nRunning counter to  this  vision,  threats  or  use of force, unilateralism, pressure, retaliation and sanctions — which increasingly characterize the behaviour and rhetoric of the United States Government and its abusive use of the veto power in the Security Council to impose its political agenda — represent immense challenges that threaten the very institution of the United Nations. Why do we not simply implement the promised strengthening of the General Assembly as the principal deliberative, decision-making and most representative organ? Security Council reform must not be delayed or sidelined; it must be updated to reflect the times and democratize its membership and working methods.\\nWe reiterate today what Commander-in-Chief of the Cuban revoluation Fidel Castro Ruz said on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations. His\\n \\nsentiments reflect the most noble aspirations of the majority of humankind:\\n“We lay claim to a world without hegemonism, without nuclear weapons, without interventionism, without racism, without national or religious hatred, without outrageous acts against the sovereignty of any country, a world with respect for the independence and self-determination of peoples, a world without universal models that totally disregard the traditions and culture of all the components of mankind.\\n“We lay claim to a world without ruthless blockades that cause the death of men, women  and children, young and old, like noiseless atom bombs.” (A/50/PV.35, pp. 19-20)\\nMore than 20 years have passed since that  demand was made, and none of those ills has been cured; on the contrary, they have got worse. We  have  every right to ask why and the duty to insist on effective and fair solutions.\\nOur Americas are today the scene of persistent threats that are incompatible with the proclamation of Latin America and the Caribbean as a zone of peace, signed in Havana in 2014 by the Heads of State and Government at the second Summit of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States. The current United States Administration has proclaimed the validity of the Monroe Doctrine and, in a new deployment of its imperial policy in the region, is attacking Venezuela with particular cruelty.\\nIn this menacing climate, we reiterate our absolute support for the Bolivarian and Chavista  revolution, the civic-military union of the Venezuelan  people  and its legitimate democratic Government, led by Constitutional President  Nicolás  Maduros  Moros. We reject the interventionist intent of the sanctions against Venezuela, aimed at economic strangulation and damaging Venezuelan families. We reject calls to isolate that sovereign nation, which is doing no harm to anyone.\\nWe likewise reject the attempts to destabilize the Government of Nicaragua, a peaceful country that has made remarkable social and economic progress and improved security for its citizens.\\nWe denounce the political imprisonment of former\\nPresident  Luiz Inácio Lula  da Silva  and  the decision\\nto prevent the people from voting for Brazil’s most popular leader and electing him to the presidency.\\nWe stand in solidarity with the Caribbean nations demanding legitimate reparations for the horrific legacy of slavery as well as the fair, special and differential treatment they deserve.\\nWe reaffirm our long-standing support for the self-determination and independence of the brotherly people of Puerto Rico.\\nWe support Argentina’s legitimate claim to sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia Islands and South Sandwich Islands.\\nWe reiterate our full support for a comprehensive, just and lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, based on the establishment of two States, permitting the Palestinian people to exercise their right to self-determination in a sovereign independent State based on the pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. We reject the unilateral action of the United States in establishing its diplomatic representation in the city of Jerusalem, which has further heightened tensions in the region. We condemn the barbarous acts committed by the Israeli forces against the civilian population in Gaza.\\nWe reaffirm our steadfast solidarity with the Sahrawi people and support the questfor a definitive solution to the question of Western Sahara that allows them to exercise their right to self-determination and to live in peace in their territory.\\nWe support the search for a peaceful and negotiated solution to the situation imposed on Syria, without foreign interference and in full respect for the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. We reject any direct or indirect intervention executed without the agreement of the legitimate authorities of that country.\\nThe  continued  expansion  of  NATO  towards  the Russian border is provoking significant danger, aggravated further still by the imposition of arbitrary sanctions, which we reject.\\nWe demand that the nuclear agreement with the Islamic Republic of Iran be implemented.\\nWe welcome the process of inter-Korean rapprochement   and   dialogue,   which   represents the path towards lasting peace, reconciliation and stability on the Korean peninsula. At the same time, we strongly condemn the imposition of unilateral\\n \\nand unjust sanctions against the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and foreign interference in Korean internal affairs.\\nThe violation of international trade rules, and the imposition of sanctions against China, the European Union and other countries will result in harmful effects, in particular for developing countries.\\nWe favour dialogue and cooperation, thanks to which we can report today that the Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and Cuba has provisionally entered into force, representing a strong foundation on which to build beneficial ties between the parties.\\nThe Government of the United States maintains its aggressive rhetoric towards Cuba and a policy aimed at subverting the political, social, economic and cultural system of my country. Contrary to the interests  of both peoples and giving in to pressure from minority interests, the United States Government has engaged in fabricating pretexts to stoke false tensions and hostilities that benefit no one. This is in stark contrast with the fact that we maintain  formal  diplomatic  relations and participate in mutually beneficial cooperation programmes in a limited number of areas. Our peoples share increasingly close historical and cultural bonds, as expressed through the arts, sports, science and the environment, among other areas. The potential for a healthy commercial relationship is well recognized, and a genuine relationship of respect would benefit the interests of the entire region.\\nHowever, the defining core component of the bilateral relationship remains the embargo, which is intended to strangle the Cuban economy, generate poverty and disrupt constitutional order. It is a cruel policy that punishes Cuban families and the entire nation. It is the most comprehensive and long-standing system of economic sanctions ever implemented against any country. It has been and remains a major obstacle to the country’s development  and to the realization   of the aspirations for progress and well-being of several generations of Cubans. As reiterated from this very rostrum for many years, through its aggressive extraterritorial implementation the embargo seriously damages the sovereignty and interests of all countries.\\nOn behalf of the Cuban people, I thank the General Assembly for its near-unanimous rejection of the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States against my country. However,\\nthat Government’s actions against my country go even further, to include public and covert programmes of gross interference in Cuba’s internal affairs, using tens of millions of dollars officially allocated in the budget to that purpose, in violation of the norms and principles upon which this Organization is based and, in particular, of Cuba’s sovereignty as an independent nation.\\nCuba stands ready to foster respectful and civilized relations with the United States Government, based on sovereign equality and mutual respect. That is the will of the Cuban people and an aspiration that we know to be shared by the majority of the citizens of the United States, especially the Cubans living there.\\nWe will continue tirelessly demanding the end of the cruel economic, commercial and financial embargo, the return of the territory illegally occupied by the United States Naval Base in Guantánamo and adequate compensation to our people for the thousands of deaths and injuries and the economic and property damage caused by this aggression over so many years.\\nCuba will always remain willing to engage in dialogue and cooperation based on respect and equal treatment. We will never make concessions that affect our national sovereignty and independence. We will not barter our principles or accept conditions. In spite of the embargo, the hostility and actions of the United States to impose regime change on Cuba, the Cuban revolution remains alive and strong, steadfast and faithful to its principles.\\nThe enemies of the revolution should not be deluded by the generational change in our Government. We represent continuity, not any sort of rupture. Cuba has continued taking steps to improve its model of economic and social development with a view to building a sovereign, independent, socialist, democratic, prosperous and sustainable nation. That is the path that our people havefreely chosen. The Cuban people will never return to the disgraces of the past, from which it freed itself by the greatest of sacrifices over 150 years of struggle for independence and dignity. In accordance with the will of the overwhelming majority of Cuban women and men, we shall press forward in the work that began almost 60 years ago.\\nIn this conviction, we have initiated a process of constitutional reform — a truly participatory democratic exercise with public discussion of the draft text which will later be submitted for approval by referendum. I am certain that there will be no changes in our strategic\\n \\nobjectives and that the irrevocable nature of socialism will be reaffirmed. The principles of our foreign policy will remain unchanged. As the First Secretary of our Party, Mr. Raúl Castro Ruz, said, on the occasion of the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations:\\n“The international community can always depend on Cuba to raise its honest voice against injustice,\\tinequality,\\tunderdevelopment, discrimination and manipulation and for the establishment of a more equitable and fair international order that really focuses on the human being, his dignity and well-being.” (A/70/ PV.14, p.6)\\nThe Cuba on behalf of which I speak today is proud to carry the torch of that independent sovereign policy, which is bound by links of brotherhood and solidarity to the world’s poor, who produce all the world’s wealth but are condemned to live in poverty by an unjust world order under the cover of words like “democracy”, “freedom” and “human rights” — words which those in power have, in fact, emptied of all meaning.\\nI am moved to be speaking from the same rostrum from which Fidel spoke the truth so powerfully 58 years ago that it still resonates with the representatives of more than 190 nations who, rejecting extortion and pressure, year on year turn the voting screen a dignified green with lights approving our demand for  an end  to the embargo. I close with the hope that the noble aspirations shared by the majority of humankind may be realized before yet further generations take to this rostrum to demand the very same things we demand today and our historic predecessors did before us.\\n',\n",
       " 'At the outset, I wish to congratulate Her Excellency María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés on assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-third session. We wish her every success. I also express our appreciation to His Excellency Miroslav Lajčák for his valuable efforts during the seventy-second session. We pay tribute also to the relentless efforts of Secretary-General António Guterres to promote the role of the United Nations and achieve its lofty goals.\\nI would like to express our sincere condolences to the family of Mr. Kofi Annan and to the United Nations on his passing. He was one of the most important symbols of the United Nations and a promoter of international cooperation, development and peace among nations.\\nThe world faces serious security, political and economic threats and challenges that do not respect borders, which represents a real test for the collective security of the United Nations. If the international community wants to achieve international peace and security, we must go beyond crisis management and seek comprehensive and just solutions, in accordance with the provisions of international law and the resolutions of international legitimacy, while rejecting selectivity, double standards and policies of the imposition of force.\\nWe recognize and appreciate the vital importance of having an international and comprehensive point of reference reﬂected in a legitimate international order that respects the rule of law. We must expedite the reform process of United Nations institutions in order to enable the Organization to shoulder its responsibilities, achieve its lofty goals and respond to the aspirations of peoples. That would enable us to bring about peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies, which is the theme\\nthat the President of the General Assembly has chosen for this session.\\nMore than a year after the illegal blockade imposed on the State of Qatar, many facts have been revealed about a pre-arranged campaign of incitement against it, as well as the insinuations and fabrications used to create the crisis. In the meantime, the international community also recognized the falseness of the allegations made against my country to justify the premeditated measures taken under the pretext of those fabricated and untrue allegations, in ﬂagrant violation of international law and basic relations between nations, as well as the values and norms of our peoples.\\nDespite all the measures taken to undermine Qatar’s security and stability and to create hardship for its people, in addition to the economic warfare launched to hinder its development process, the period that followed that unjust siege has witnessed the strengthening of the status of the State of Qatar and the consolidation of its role as an active partner in the regional and international arenas. Moreover, the Qatari economy has continued to grow, proof of its vigour and consistency. The State of Qatar has also maintained its advanced and leading rankings compared with other countries of the region in global indicators, especially in the areas of human security and human development. That has strengthened the Qatari people’s faith in their potential, values and principles and increased their cohesion and unity.\\nBelieving in the soundness of our legal  position, in the need for the peaceful settlement of disputes and in dialogue as the best way to resolve crises, we have been, and remain, positively responsive to all the efforts of brotherly and friendly nations, which we appreciate, to end this crisis through unconditional dialogue, based on mutual respect for the sovereignty of nations.\\nIt is not reasonable for differences of opinion on the handling of some regional issues to lead to paralysing the effectiveness of an important regional organization such as the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). The blockade on Qatar has harmed the reputation of the GCC countries, and the paralysis of the GCC has reflected negatively on the role it aspires to play in dealing with regional and global issues. We hope that we will all be able to transform the current plight of the GCC into an opportunity for reform and to put forward binding mechanisms to resolve the differences among\\n \\nits States through dialogue, so as to avoid any similar recurrence in future.\\nIt is not right that our Arab region remains hostage because of some marginal differences — fabricated,  in our case — which consume efforts and energy and waste more funds than we allocate to the just causes upon which we are supposed to agree.\\nLittle progress has been made on the lingering Middle East issues, especially the Palestinian question, which represents the last vestiges of our world’s colonial past. The political process that began 25 years ago was an example of a departure from United Nations terms of reference to frameworks outside the Organization, which were perceived by some as the best and fastest way to settle and find solutions to that question. That process was supported by the Arab States and respectful of the Palestinian decision, but it has resulted in further stalemate and complexity. We are now witnessing attempts to eliminate the Palestinian question by disregarding issues relating to a permanent solution, such as those of Jerusalem,  refugees,  sovereignty  and borders.\\nJust national issues cannot be resolved by becoming entangled in the balance of power between the occupier and the occupied. Such issues can be resolved only in accordance with certain principles, such as the right  to self-determination and the inadmissibility of the annexation of territories of others by force, which have become part of international legitimacy.\\nThe deterioration of the situation in the Palestinian territories, particularly the inhumane conditions  in the Gaza Strip, the suffocating siege to which it is subjected and the continued construction of settlements in occupied Jerusalem and the West Bank, are having grave consequences and place a historic responsibility on the Security Council. We reaffirm the importance of negotiations, whose resumption is vital and which will require a commitment to resolutions of international legitimacy, foremost among which are the two-State solution and the Arab Peace Initiative, based on East Jerusalem as the capital of the Palestinian State, along the 1967 borders. Moreover, there can be no solution to the Arab-Israeli conﬂict without a just and lasting solution to the Palestinian question.  We  abide  by  that position, which is consistent with international legitimacy and morally just. However, Israel rejects such a just settlement.\\nThe State of Qatar will spare no effort in providing various forms of material and political support to the brotherly Palestinian people and in continuing to work with all international actors involved in the Middle East peace process so as to overcome the difficulties that are obstructing the resumption of peace negotiations, in accordance with the terms of reference and resolutions of international legitimacy.\\nAfter more than seven years, the international community  remains  unable to  find  a  solution  to the worsening Syrian crisis  in  all  its  aspects  and  its dangerous consequences. The Syrian people, in addition to the tragedies they have experienced, are concerned and frustrated that the crimes of genocide, mass displacement and large-scale death in prisons, under torture, could become common practice and that the international community might get used to it.\\nFailure to deter the Syrian regime from committing crimes by waging a  war against its own people, on  the one hand, and failure to hold it accountable after the commission of such crimes, on the other, would render the provisions of international law and human rights law devoid of meaning. That would have serious consequences for the prevailing values of our world,  as it would promote the use of violence as a means of suppressing peoples’ aspirations and trampling on the rights of citizens and peoples of our region.\\nWe are facing a humanitarian, moral and legal disaster that requires the international community to urgently reach a political solution that stops the Syrian bloodshed, fulfils Syrian aspirations to justice and freedom, maintains Syria’s unity and sovereignty and achieves security and stability in Syria and the region, in accordance with the first Geneva communiqué (S/2012/522, annex) and the relevant Security Council resolutions. We emphasize the necessity of abiding by international humanitarian law and protecting civilians.\\nRegarding the Yemeni issue, we underscore that the firm position of the State of Qatar is to remain committed to the unity, independence and territorial integrity of Yemen. We call upon all Yemeni  parties to achieve national reconciliation and end the conﬂict, on the basis of Security Council resolution 2216 (2015), the Initiative of the Gulf Cooperation Council and the outcomes of the national dialogue. From  this rostrum I appeal to States that are active in the international community to help the brotherly Yemeni people to overcome current conditions, which we hope will soon\\n \\nend, take all measures necessary to address the grave humanitarian situation and facilitate free access for humanitarian assistance to all areas of Yemen. In that regard, I wish to announce Qatar’s agreement with the United Nations to fight cholera in Yemen by supporting projects related to combating the causes of the disease and to halting its spread. We call upon other countries to join us in supporting that vital effort.\\nTurning to the Libyan crisis, which has recently witnessed developments that place the country’s security and territorial integrity at risk, we look forward to the restoration of security and stability despite the tremendous challenges facing our Libyan  brothers. We note that foreign intervention in Libyan affairs further complicates the crisis, prevents the reaching  of the national consensus that is sought by our Libyan brothers and contravenes Security Council resolutions. We reiterate our support for the Skhirat Agreement, signed in December 2015, and all its outcomes. We  call upon all Libyan brothers to uphold the country’s national interests and participate in a dialogue, without excluding any component of Libyan society, in order to reach a comprehensive political settlement that preserves Libya’s sovereignty and territorial integrity and realizes the aspirations of its people to security and stability.\\nTurning to brotherly Iraq, we once again express our appreciation for the efforts of the Iraqi Government in restoring stability and achieving national reconciliation by cooperating with all political parties and components of the Iraqi society. We value the successes and sacrifices of the Iraqi people in the fight against terrorism and extremism in all its forms. We reaffirm our commitment to supporting brotherly Iraq in the process of its reconstruction and development and assisting in every effort to seek to ensure its unity and sovereignty and enhance its security and stability.\\nThere is consensus that terrorism  has  become one of the most persistent challenges facing the world because of the real threat it poses to international peace and security. We underline the firm position of the State of Qatar in rejecting terrorism in all its forms and manifestations anywhere in the world, regardless of reason or pretext. The fight against terrorism is a priority of the State of Qatar’s policy at the national, regional and international levels. We have developed legislative and institutional systems, fulfilled our international obligations related to the fight against terrorism and its\\nfinancing, and participated in all relevant international\\nand regional efforts.\\nIn our view, the following prerequisites are necessary to ensure that the war on terrorism achieves its goal and does not turn into a self-contained struggle. First, we need international cooperation in combating violence resulting from extremism and violence directed against civilians as a form of terror and aimed at damaging civilian facilities for political ends. Those phenomena must be  addressed  firmly and rigorously. Secondly, we must unify standards for fighting terrorism so that its definition is not selective and does not depend on the religious or ethnic identity of the perpetrator. Thirdly, we must address its root causes and research the political, social and cultural backgrounds that contribute to fuelling it while working earnestly to achieve the just settlement of outstanding issues that give rise to anger and frustration. Fourthly, we must avoid giving any partisan connotation to the term “terrorism” by tailoring it to fit into the narrow interests of some nations and using it to justify tyranny and the repression of political opponents, which affects the credibility of the combat against terrorism and undermines the international efforts made in that field.\\nWith that in mind, the State of  Qatar  believes that educating young people and ensuring their comprehensive participation represents the first line of defence for the collective security system, as they are an important factor in fighting terrorism and building peace and stability. We have therefore committed to educating 10 million children and providing economic support to half a million young people in our region. In collaboration with the United Nations, we have carried out projects to promote  employment  opportunities  for young people through capacity-building and have launched programmes to prevent violent extremism.\\nHuman development and the protection and promotion of human rights are at the forefront of our priorities. The State of Qatar is  pursuing efforts at  the legislative and institutional levels  to implement its 2030 national vision, which emphasizes human development. This month, the State of Qatar acceded to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The State of Qatar recently enacted a law regulating the issue of political asylum in the country, following the steps of developed countries, and another law granting the right to permanent residence in the State under conditions prescribed by\\n \\nlaw. It has also decided to invite several international human rights organizations to establish regional offices in our country.\\nNo one doubts the importance of the development of information and digital technology and digital means of communication. The economy and day- to-day life would be inconceivable without them. However, a series of recent events in several countries have reminded us that new needs are emerging, such as the need for freedom of access and the need to protect the private lives of citizens from the risk of hacking. It also alerted us to the cybersecurity of nations, which is a cross-border issue because of the nature of the technology itself.\\nAccordingly, we must regulate how those issues are dealt with and control their risks internationally. Qatar and other countries have suffered from digital piracy and digital espionage,  which  has  prompted  us to strongly emphasize the  issue.  We  are willing  to work with United Nations bodies to devise legal regulations. In that regard, we propose the convening of an international conference to examine means of regulation in that area by international law, and we express our readiness to host such a conference.\\n',\n",
       " 'The statements delivered during this session’s general debate confirm that international relations are now being conducted in a complex and controversial period of history.\\nToday, we are all witnessing two opposing trends collide. On the one hand, we  see the strengthening    of polycentric principles of world order, the steady development of new centres of economic growth and peoples’ aspirations to preserve their sovereignty and choose development models that are consistent with their national, cultural and religious identities. On the other hand, we see the desire of a number of Western States to retain their self-proclaimed status as world leaders and slow the irreversible and objective process of establishing multipolarity. To that  end,  they  do not hesitate to use every possible method, including political blackmail, economic pressure and brute force.\\nSuch illegal actions  devalue the  international law that underpins the post-war world order. We hear statements trumpeted that not only call into question the legal validity of international treaties, but also prioritize self-serving unilateral approaches over decisions made within the United Nations. We are seeing an assault  by belligerent revisionism on the modern system of international law. There have been attacks on the basic principles of the Middle East peace process, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on the Iranian nuclear programme, commitments under the framework of  the World Trade Organization, the multilateral Paris Agreement on Climate Change and many more.\\nAt the same time, our Western colleagues continue to seek to replace the supremacy of law in world affairs with some kind of so-called rules-based order. Those\\n \\nrules themselves are invented depending on whatever is politically expedient and are a reflection of double standards. Baseless accusations of interference in the internal affairs of various countries are being made alongside overt attempts to undermine and topple democratically elected Governments. Efforts are being made to draw some countries into military alliances that are designed to further specific agendas against the will of the peoples of those countries, while other States are threatened with punishment for their free choice of partners and allies. It is telling that aggressive attacks on international institutions are being accompanied by attempts to privatize their secretariat structures and grant them the rights of intergovernmental bodies in the hope of manipulating them later.\\nThe shrinking space for constructive international cooperation, escalating confrontations, a growing overall lack of predictability, and a substantially higher risk of spontaneous conflicts all affect the work of this global Organization. The international  community has to pay a high price for the parochial, self-serving ambitions of a small group of countries. The collective mechanisms for responding to common security challenges have stalled. Diplomacy and a culture of negotiation and compromise are increasingly replaced by dictates and unilateral extraterritorial restrictions effected without the consent of the Security Council. Such measures, which have already been applied to dozens of countries, are ineffective as well as illegal, as demonstrated by the more  than  half-century  of the United States blockade of Cuba, which has been condemned by the entire international community.\\nOnce again, however, the lessons are not being drawn from history. The number of those who  want  to hand down verdicts without bothering with charges or trials is not getting any smaller. Today assumptions in the spirit of the notorious “highly likely” approach seem to provide sufficient grounds for some of our Western colleagues to make accusations against anyone they want to. We have already been through that, and we well remember how often spurious pretexts have been used to justify interventions and unleash wars, as was the case in Yugoslavia in 1999, Iraq in 2003 and Libya in 2011. The same methods are being used in Syria today. On 14 April, missile strikes were launched against Syria on a completely invented pretext, just hours before international inspectors were expected to arrive at the site of an incident that had been staged. This is a warning against any further provocations\\nby terrorists and their patrons involving the use of chemical weapons, which would be unacceptable.\\nThe conflict in Syria has already lasted seven years. The failed attempt to effect regime change, which was orchestrated from outside and relied on extremists, nearly resulted in the country’s disintegration and the emergence of a terrorist caliphate in its place. Russia’s energetic action, in response to the request of the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic and supported by diplomatic efforts in the context of the Astana process, helped prevent that devastating  scenario. The Syrian National Dialogue Congress, initiated by Russia, Iran and Turkey in Sochi in January, established the conditions for a political settlement in line with Security Council resolution 2254 (2015), and the basis for the intra-Syrian constitutional committee now being established in Geneva. Its agenda includes the restoration of ruined infrastructure in order to facilitate the return of millions of refugees to their homes. Assistance in addressing those issues in the interest of all Syrians, without double standards, must become a priority for international efforts and the activities of United Nations agencies.\\nDespite the complexity of the situation in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Libya, we  must  not  lose  sight  of the long-standing Palestinian question. A just and equitable solution to that issue is crucial to improving the situation throughout the Middle East. I want to warn against any unilateral  approaches  in  this area or attempts to monopolize this peace process. Today, as never before, the international community should consolidate its efforts with the aim of restarting talks on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative. Russia will continue to do its utmost to facilitate the process, including within the Middle East Quartet and in cooperation with the League of Arab States and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. Mutually acceptable agreements must ensure the peaceful and safe coexistence of the two States of Israel and Palestine.\\nHere at the United Nations, which was created on the basis of lessons learned from the Second World War, we must all think about a future in which the repetition of past mistakes should have no place. This year marks the eightieth anniversary of the notorious Munich agreement crowning the criminal policy of appeasement of the Third Reich, a sad example of the catastrophic consequences that can result from national\\n \\negotism, disregard for international law and attempts to solve problems at others’ expense.\\nRegrettably, in a number of countries today not only has the vaccine against the Nazi plague been weakened, but a rising campaign to rewrite history and whitewash war criminals and their associates is  emerging.  In our view, the campaigns being waged in a number of countries to demolish monuments to the liberators of Europe are an outrage. We call on the Assembly to support the draft of this year’s versin of the annual resolution on the inadmissibility of glorification of the Nazis.\\nThe growth of radical nationalism and neo-fascism in Ukraine, where criminals who fought under Waffen- SS banners have been declared heroes, is one of the main factors in the protracted intra-Ukrainian conflict. The only way to settle that conflict is to ensure the comprehensive and consistent implementation in good faith of the Minsk package of measures, approved unanimously by the Security Council in its resolution 2202 (2015). We support the activities of the Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and are ready to provide its monitors with United Nations protection.\\nHowever, instead of implementing the Minsk agreements and engaging in dialogue with Donetsk and Luhansk, Kyiv continues to harbour the illusion that it may be able to put occupying forces in Donbas with the support of the West and is increasingly threatening to resort to military options. The sponsors of the current Kyiv authorities must bring their clients to their senses, make them lift the blockade of Donbas and end discrimination against ethnic minorities throughout Ukraine.\\nIn Kosovo, the international military presence authorized by the Security Council is being transformed into a United States military base, and Kosovo armed forces are being created. The agreements between Belgrade and Pristina brokered by the European Union are not being implemented. Russia calls on the parties to engage in dialogue in accordance with the principles of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) and will support a decision that would be acceptable for Serbia. In general, we urge that the Balkans not be once again transformed into an arena for confrontation or declared to be someone’s particular patrimony. The peoples of the Balkans must not be forced to face a false choice,\\nand we must prevent new dividing lines from emerging in the region.\\nWe need to shape an architecture of equal and indivisible security elsewhere in the world, including the Asia-Pacific region. We welcome the positive developments on the Korean peninsula following the logic of the Russian-Chinese road map. It is important to encourage that process, which should be based on continuing the rapprochement between the  parties and on promoting the practical implementation of the important arrangements arrived at by Pyongyang and Seoul through the Security Council. We will continue to work to launch a multilateral process aimed at establishing a robust mechanism for peace and security in North-East Asia as soon as possible.\\nThe denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is among the tasks before the international community in the key security area of the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Regrettably, serious obstacles to that track continue to pile up. The unilateral withdrawal by the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, in violation of Security Council resolution 2231 (2015), and despite Iran’s full compliance with its obligations, came on top of the lack of progress in the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. We will do everything possible to preserve the deal approved by the Security Council.\\nWe are seeing increasingly negative  trends  in  the activities of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) whereby the West is attempting to transform the Technical Secretariat into an instrument for punishing undesirable Governments, which risks compromising the OPCW’s independent professional status, the universality of the Chemical Weapons Convention and the  exclusive  prerogatives of the Security Council. Those and other problems in the area of non-proliferation were discussed in detail in the Security Council on 26 September (see S/PV.8362), convened at a very timely moment by the United States presidency.\\nWe firmly believe that any problems or concerns that arise in international relations should be addressed through a substantive dialogue. If there are any bones of contention, we should come together around the negotiating table, engage in talks, present facts, heed\\n \\nthe our partners’ counterarguments and seek a balance of interests.\\nIn the past couple of years, the debate on abuses in cyberspace has become more intense. I would like to draw attention to the fact that it was Russia that initiated discussion of international information-security issues at the United Nations 20 years ago. Against the backdrop of recent developments, it is becoming ever more urgent that under the auspices of the United Nations we should develop global rules for the responsible behaviour of States in cyberspace, including the principles of the non-use of force, non-interference in internal affairs and respect for State sovereignty. We intend to introduce a draft resolution to that effect in the First Committee. We also believe that it is important to start work on a convention on cybercrime, and we envisage holding the relevant discussions in the Third Committee.\\nIt is more essential than ever to seek mutually acceptable agreements and the mutual consideration of interests in the areas of global trade and economic relations, which today are being subjected to an unprecedented degree of politicization. The values of free trade are being held hostage to trade wars and other forms of unfair competition.\\nRussia has consistently  promoted  a  philosophy of shared economic development,  as  enshrined  in  the Greater Eurasian Partnership initiative launched by President Vladimir Putin, a large-scale project open to all Asian and European States regardless of their membership in other integration associations. If consistently implemented, it could help to develop a the space for extensive economic cooperation in Eurasia. In the long term, it could lay the foundations for a renewed continental security architecture fit for the realities of the twenty-first century.\\nRussia will continue to do its utmost to build a world based on law, truth and justice, and we are not alone in that aspiration. Together with us, our allies and partners in the Collective Security Treaty Organization, the Eurasian Economic Community, the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) group and an overwhelming majority of other countries are advocating for the democratization of all aspects of international affairs and in the interests of all States, without exception. The West should also heed that voice, which is becoming\\nmore and more evident in the activities of the Group  of 20.\\nIn today’s turbulent circumstances, the growing relevance of the United Nations — the only existing forum for overcoming differences and coordinating the activities of the international community — is an objective reality. Cooperation, with a view to arriving at broadly acceptable solutions, was a priority built into the foundations of the United Nations from the very start. Today we must not fail to live up to the high goals and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and its dedication by the drafters to future generations.\\nWe should recall the art of negotiation in order to be worthy of their legacy. Many of today’s problems can be solved only on a basis of equality and mutual respect. Dictates and coercion, hallmarks of the era of colonialism, should once and for all be filed away in the archives or, better yet, consigned to the dustbin of history.\\nSome great statesmen of the past have bequeathed to us many words of wisdom that have come to be aphorisms. Let me quote just one, from President Harry Truman: “The responsibility of the great States is to serve and not to dominate the world”.\\nI hope that a culture of mutually respectful dialogue will finally prevail. Russia will do everything it can to achieve that.\\n']"

       "['\\ufeff212.\\tThe opportunity we have at this time to address this illustrious Assembly of the United Nations—the symbol for all the peoples represented here of hope for a future marked by harmony, respect, equality and co-operation among nations—enables us to express cur satisfaction at noting that some progress has been made towards such a future despite the fact that these objectives are still far from being embodied in international practice.\\n213.\\tWe wish to share in the responsibility, incumbent upon us all, of debating in this forum the topics that we\\nbelieve to be fundamental for the progress of mankind. Collective security, peace and development are topics which concern all peoples in this world in which interdependence is becoming an increasingly clear reality. It is with pleasure that we note the consolidation of the principles for which we have always fought and the increasing acceptance of the\\n\\naspirations and legitimate demands of the countries of the third world for a greater and more equal participation in the resolution of the problems that trouble us all.\\n214.\\tIt is in this framework of a progressive and salutary democratization of international relations that we greet the admission of Solomon Islands as the one hundred and fiftieth Member of the United Nations and at the same time we wish its people and Government, as they begin to enjoy the natural euphoria of freedom and the responsibility of an independent life, great success on the long road of progress and development.\\n215.\\tMr. President, your recognized qualities as a statesman and a diplomat experienced in international affairs convince us that the work of this session will be directed with all the skill required by the complexities of the problems we are going to discuss.\\n216.\\tWe should also like to pay a tribute to the outgoing President, the representative of a country which for many decades has given an example of a consistent policy in defence of international legality. We must recognize that Mr. Mojsov guaranteed the success of the thirty-second session of this Assembly.\\n217.\\tIt would be no more than simple justice to take advantage of our presence in this Assembly to draw attention to the tireless and skilful work of the Secretary- General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, who, by his consistent activity in the service of international peace and security and healthy co-operation among nations, has contributed undeniably to the strengthening of the credibility and effectiveness of our world Organization. Therefore we wish to offer to Mr. Waldheim all our support in his efforts to give concrete form to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and we reiterate our constant readiness to take part in joint action by nations in favour of the freedom, independence, development and the well- being of peoples.\\n218.\\tWe have just left a world in which a fierce struggle was necessary to gain recognition of the rights of peoples to be independent and to choose the ways they consider most suitable for their development.\\n219.\\tWe are the beneficiaries of this new legality which allows us to believe in the possibility of increasingly peaceful coexistence among countries at different levels of development and with different social structures. We are the beneficiaries of this struggle, which has been our struggle too for a very long time, since it can be asserted that our diplomatic history began, like that of Guinea- Bissau, at the moment when the PAIGC  began the struggle for the independence of our peoples. However, our struggle in fact was merely a concrete expression of the principles which have been reiterated year after year in this Assembly and which are embodied in all the fundamental documents of this Organization.\\n220.\\tWe believe that we have contributed by our efforts to the effective recognition of these principles, which constitute the basis of the international law of our time.\\n221.\\tThe geographical situation of my country, at the crossroad? of peoples and continents, constitutes one of its advantages. This position has always enabled Cape Verde to play an important role in bringing peoples together, which is perfectly in keeping with the guiding principles of our policy of non-alignment.\\n222.\\tThus we reaffirm that the Republic of Cape Verde will never shelter foreign military bases or serve as a liaison or support centre for aggressive operations against sovereign peoples and States.\\n223.\\tWe believe that peace, the necessary condition for development, will become a reality only when the rules established by all are implemented by all and guide the daily relations among nations. That is how we view our participation in the international community.\\n224.\\tThis Assembly, as in the past, continues to be a forum for repeated condemnation of attempts to perpetuate in Africa anachronistic situations marked by colonial and racist domination and apartheid. The praiseworthy and patient efforts of the international community, an echo of the liberation struggle of the peoples of Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa, which are reflected in the many resolutions of the United Nations condemning the minority regimes of southern Africa, have merely prompted the intensification of the terror inflicted on defenceless populations, the aggression against independent African States, the absolute lack of respect for and permanent defiance of the international community and the desire of the peoples of southern Africa for a life of dignity and peace. The indisputable evidence of this defiance of our world Organization is the recent decision of the South African Government to proceed unilaterally with a process leading to elections in Namibia which will inevitably be falsified, deliberately and dangerously disregarding the legitimate claims of the people of Namibia and its authentic representative, SWAPO, and flouting with barefaced arrogance every initiative aiming at a peaceful transition to independence.\\n225.\\tWe have always been convinced that the racist and apartheid regimes, since they are working against the tide of history, have never been ready to accept dialogue or to abandon the savage methods by which they trample underfoot the most fundamental human rights and resort systematically to violence against sovereign peoples and States, and this conviction has been reiterated year after year in this Assembly. Recent events persuade us that it is necessary and urgent that the international community multiply, diversify and centralize its efforts to assist SWAPO, the liberation movement fighting for the national independence and the territorial integrity of Namibia.\\n226.\\tThe people of Zimbabwe today are compelled to try to deal with a new farce: those who practise colonial oppression and defend apartheid have now taken up the banner of majority power and are claiming to lead the process for the transfer of power to the majority, oblivious of the freedom fighters united in the Patriotic Front. The kind of solution that neglects the profound aspirations of the people of Zimbabwe to genuine independence amounts to nothing but ad hoc concessions to the pressure brought to bear by the liberation struggle, which, we solemnly reaffirm, deserves our complete solidarity.\\n227.\\tIn 1975, when welcoming the independence of Mozambique and Angola, we welcomed at the same time the emergence of a different stage in the struggle of the people of southern Africa. The buffer States disappeared and were replaced by two independent countries, strengthened by the example they gave to others and determined not to accept the situation prevailing south of their borders.\\n228.\\tThe growing isolation of that bastion of colonialism—to which the efforts made in the United Nations have contributed significantly and were certainly consolidated by the decisions of the recent World Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination and the heroic resistance of the people of South Africa, led by their liberation movements, are driving the regime to exasperation, and, becoming even more defiant, it is systematically committing aggression with impunity against neighbouring countries.\\n229.\\tWe pay a tribute to those true interpreters of noble objectives who presided over the creation of the highest international body. It is the duty of the international community throughout the International Anti-Apartheid Year and the\\' Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination to try to find effective ways of further isolating the anachronistic Pretoria regime and wiping out the historic shame of apartheid. Experience shows that this requires the strengthening of the capacity for action of the liberation movements.\\n230.\\tIn keeping with our experience of the national liberation struggle and as a country recently liberated from colonial oppression after two long decades of political and armed struggle, we understand the true dimensions of the immeasurable suffering imposed on the people of the Western Sahara in its struggle for the liberation of that Territory, which is illegally occupied and divided. Our solidarity with the peoples struggling against all kinds of oppression and opposition to the exercise of their right to self-determination and independence in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) reinforces our conviction that the dispute between the Saharan people and those who occupy its national territory can be peacefully and justly resolved only by the effective exercise by that people of their right to determine their own destiny in sovereignty and freedom.\\n231.\\tIn the same way, we stand shoulder to shoulder with the peoples of East Timor who are fighting for the total realization of their desire for freedom and independence.\\n232.\\tIn the Middle East, a situation persists which defies the general feeling of the international community, which has been clearly, repeatedly and unambiguously expressed in this Assembly and in other bodies of our Organization. The persistence in a policy of aggression, occupation and expansion, accompanied by attempts to transform demographic, economic, cultural and religious structures of regions conquered by force, represents a flagrant violation of the principles of the United Nations and furthermore constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security.\\n233.\\tSince our country is one of the youngest Members of this great family of sovereign and independent nations, and since we received from the United Nations considerable support during our national liberation struggle and even after independence, we are accustomed to viewing the Organization as the main guarantor or\\' international legality and the defender of the just claims of peoples for a life of peace, justice and progress.\\n234.\\tAs stubborn defenders of the ideals of the United Nations, of the movements of the non-aligned countries and of the OAU, we note with great concern the acts of aggression committed against Lebanon and the frequent violations of its territorial integrity and sovereignty. All States of the region are entitled to live in peace, independence and security. But a just and lasting peace will never be achieved until Israel decides to withdraw completely from all the Arab territory which it has occupied since 1967 and until it recognizes the legitimate, permanent and inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people and agrees to the effective exercise of those rights, including the right to establish a national and independent State.\\n235.\\tWe should like to reaffirm our unstinting support of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole legitimate representative of that martyred people, and our conviction that a definitive solution of the problem of the Middle East cannot be found without the active participation of the freedom fighters of the Palestine Liberation Organization on a footing of equality with all other parties directly involved in the conflict. Meanwhile we are following with keen interest the continuing efforts that are being made to try to establish suitable conditions for negotiations which, while respecting the basic and inalienable claims of the Palestinian people, would point the way to a peaceful and just solution.\\n236.\\tAs we commemorate this year the thirtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we should like to take this opportunity to express our satisfaction at the positive role which the United Nations has played in the field of human rights. Indeed, the establishment of norms of international law in this connexion, the consecration of the right of peoples to self-determination and independence, and the initiatives taken in the field of the struggle against discrimination, racism, apartheid, torture and crimes against peace and humanity, as well as the special attention accorded to cases of the flagrant violation of human rights, are results of unquestionable importance to the credit of United Nations activity in this field, and it is a pleasure for me to emphasize them here.\\n237.\\tThe Republic of Cape Verde, the fruit of a genuine battle for human rights consisting in the long and hard political and armed struggle successfully carried out by PAIGC against Portuguese colonialism, can only rejoice at the visibly positive balance-sheet of the activities of our world Organization on behalf of human rights and freedoms.\\n238.\\tAfter independence a new administration was set up in our country based on broad popular participation, which is being restructured and consolidated and which is dedicated to guaranteeing to all citizens fundamental political and civil rights and freedoms. However, we feel that the struggle is continuing beyond the time of national independence, because the question of human rights cannot be dissociated from the economic, social and cultural context. Indeed, the effective, total and conscious exercise of civil and political rights is practically impossible without the establishment of certain basic economic, social and cultural conditions. There is consequently an essential interdependence of fundamental human rights which cannot be ignored.\\n239.\\tThe struggle for human rights is therefore in our country a process that is still continuing. Internally we are establishing the basis for economic development without which it would be impossible to free man from the spectre of hunger, poverty, disease, ignorance and illiteracy.\\n240.\\tOn the other hand, the question of human rights goes beyond the purely national sphere and is closely tied to certain questions of an international nature which are among the most important of our time. The effective exercise of human rights is not possible while the present international order persists and while colonialism, racism, apartheid and foreign domination and occupation prevail. However, the extension to the international level of problems of human rights must not make legitimate their use as a means of pressure, which might give rise to a climate of tension in relations between States.\\n241.\\tWe think that the United Nations should continue to play an important role in the promotion and safeguarding of human rights through the organs that it has set up, whose possibilities have not yet been exhausted and whose effectiveness has already been demonstrated on several occasions.\\n242.\\tWe should also like to express\\' our solidarity with those who deplore the incongruity of the fact that in a world where the spectre of hunger afflicts millions of human beings, nations continue year after year to spend enormous sums of money on the manufacture and stockpiling of arms. It is also to be deplored that an increasing part of the trade between nations is made up of the buying and selling of military equipment, while a large part of the population of the world remains without support in its struggle for the protection of the environment and the production of food and against ignorance, disease and natural disasters.\\n243.\\tThe continuance of a system where peace is merely the result of the permanent fear of reciprocal destruction cannot but contribute to increase tension in international relations and to divert States from their main task, which is to guarantee the well-being of their peoples. The need to put an end to the arms race and to initiate a procedure that will lead to real disarmament is felt very deeply by the whole of the international community. In this process at different regional levels great progress has been made, and laudable initiatives have been taken for the conclusion of agreements on the limitation of strategic weapons and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. In this process the United Nations, as the sole body capable of giving a universal dimension to the struggle for peace, security and development, should play an important role.\\n244.\\tThe fruitful results of this kind of thinking have already been confirmed by the tenth special session of the\\nGeneral. Assembly devoted to disarmament, convened in accordance with an initiative of the non-aligned countries.\\n245.\\tWe hope that the United Nations Disarmament Commission will be in a position to ensure the implementation of the decisions taken at that special session and to provide elements for a global programme of disarmament . At the same time we welcome the creation of the Committee on Disarmament, a body in which the nuclear Powers and a number of countries including many non-aligned countries will participate on an equal footing.\\n246.\\tIt is a fact that the existence of large stocks of weapons, particularly of non-conventional weapons, is a constant threat to the survival of all mankind.\\n247.\\tIn such conditions we think that through the United Nations all countries will be able to participate actively in\\nthe creation of a lasting policy for international security.\\n\\n248.\\tInternational economic relations are still hampered by the contradictions that arise from the imbalance that exists today between the rich and industrialized countries on the one hand and the poor underdeveloped countries on the other.\\n249.\\tIt is that system of international economic relations, the mechanisms of which contribute to the accentuation of this imbalance and hinder efforts towards development, which has been and continues to be the subject of debate in the United Nations, particularly, in the sixth and seventh special sessions of this Assembly.\\n250.\\tIn this context we are witnessing a growing awareness of the need to create a new order with values that will govern international economic relations. The various sessions of UNCTAD, the United Nations Conference on Technical Co-operation among Developing Countries, held at Buenos Aires, and the agreements between the African, Caribbean and Pacific group and the European Economic Community, among others, are examples of such concern.\\n251.\\tThe pursuit of this objective, we must admit, has met with obstacles which give rise to doubts and questionings and might make a really constructive dialogue more difficult to achieve. The existing monetary disturbances, the growing monetary erosion, in particular in countries with relatively weak economies, the deterioration in the terms of trade between countries supplying raw materials and industrialized countries, together with the protectionism practised by certain countries, justify our concern.\\n\\n252.\\tWe are at a stage in the history of mankind when the existing basis of the international economic order is being questioned and it is our great responsibility to reflect on and consider the principles which should govern future international economic relations.\\n253.\\tIn our opinion the creation of a new international economic order should comprise: first, the recognition of the objective needed to alter the existing economic order and to achieve the participation of all countries on an equal footing in the solution of the problems which afflict mankind, and, with that recognition, the political will to give it effect; secondly, an increase in the technical and technological capacity of the developing countries, to enable them thus to benefit from the achievements of science and technology; thirdly, financial assistance in order . attain at least the objective of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product as established by the United Nations; fourthly, special assistance to the least developed among the developing countries, which, besides suffering the injustice of the present system have to confront naturally unfavourable conditions; and fifthly, effective support for the Buenos Aires Programme of Action on technical co-operation among developing countries.\\n254.\\tWe are convinced that the United Nations has a considerable role to play in the realization of the objectives that we have mentioned.\\n255.\\tWe \"expect, moreover, the constructive co-operation of members of the Committee of the Whole so that that Committee may fully exercise the functions which we consider to be extremely important in defining the new international economic order.\\n256.\\tWe are an island country, a small territory with limited natural resources, and consequently we attach particular importance to questions concerning the appropriation and distribution of maritime resources and, generally, to all problems relating to the law of the sea. When in December 1970 General Assembly resolution 2749 (XXV) was adopted, it was welcomed as an invaluable instrument for the definition of a new international economic order and as a legitimate expression of the hope of countries which, like our own, do not have the necessary technological means successfully to exploit the resources of the sea-bed on their own.\\n257.\\tHowever, the results of the latest session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea have cast a shadow on the promising prospects that had opened in the course of continuing negotiations towards a definition of international law in that field. Indeed, at that session we heard talk of unilateral legislation, an idea which, if maintained, would run counter to the positions previously adopted by the international community.\\n258.\\tWe are certain that an understanding of the importance of a successful conclusion of the work of that Conference will ensure that our efforts will not end in a failure which would seriously affect international relations.\\n259.\\tIn Cape Verde we are now totally involved in the struggle for national reconstruction, a struggle that is particularly difficult if one considers the chaotic situation which we inherited.\\n260.\\tWe are reduced to constituting, almost inch by inch, the land that we shall have to work, to creating out of nothing the conditions for the survival of our people and to building the structures of a democratic State on what was left us by the ruinous inertia of a colonial Power.\\n261.\\tWe have to waste a great deal of energy and effort to reverse the situation of impoverishment created in our country by centuries of neglect. Desertification, emigration and social imbalance are still the deep-rooted signs of the system which we fought and abolished.\\n262.\\tThe United Nations, which has always supported and been able to channel and stimulate international solidarity with our people, will evaluate during this session the report prepared by the United Nations mission which, in pursuance of resolution 32/99 [A/331167 and Corr. l], recently visited our country.\\n263.\\tWe should like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to all those who have given our country timely and much-needed assistance. We are certain that, duly enlightened by this document, the United Nations and the donor countries will then be in a position to increase their co-operation with our country. That co-operation continues to be an invaluable aid in the solution of the many very urgent problems which we face and is a significant contribution to the establishment of suitable infrastructures for the economic and social development of Cape Verde.\\n264.\\tBefore concluding, we wish to express our ever growing confidence in the activities and the future of the United Nations which, while consolidating year by year both its prestige and its representativeness with the admission of a growing number of States, is also making praiseworthy efforts to improve its structure and inculcate new dynamism into its bodies in order to be able to resolve the many serious and complex problems that afflict mankind.\\n265.\\tWe are convinced that the United Nations provides the appropriate and privileged forum in which to find solutions which will meet the fundamental concerns of our time, and in which the nations which emerge in future from the struggle legitimized by the noble purposes which inspire this Organization will be heard.\\n266.\\tAs the head of the Government of the Republic of . Cape Verde, I wish to reaffirm our support for the principles which have always guided our actions, in particular those of the non-alignment, self-determination and independence of peoples, respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, mutual respect, reciprocal advantage and peaceful coexistence among all the peoples of the world.\\n267.\\tWe sincerely hope that the work of this session will constitute a step towards the consolidation of the progress already made in the building of a future which promises freedom and happiness for all people, and will lead to the progress that we all so earnestly desire.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n']"

       "['\\ufeff212.\\tThe opportunity we have at this time to address this illustrious Assembly of the United Nations—the symbol for all the peoples represented here of hope for a future marked by harmony, respect, equality and co-operation among nations—enables us to express cur satisfaction at noting that some progress has been made towards such a future despite the fact that these objectives are still far from being embodied in international practice.\\n213.\\tWe wish to share in the responsibility, incumbent upon us all, of debating in this forum the topics that we\\nbelieve to be fundamental for the progress of mankind. Collective security, peace and development are topics which concern all peoples in this world in which interdependence is becoming an increasingly clear reality. It is with pleasure that we note the consolidation of the principles for which we have always fought and the increasing acceptance of the\\n\\naspirations and legitimate demands of the countries of the third world for a greater and more equal participation in the resolution of the problems that trouble us all.\\n214.\\tIt is in this framework of a progressive and salutary democratization of international relations that we greet the admission of Solomon Islands as the one hundred and fiftieth Member of the United Nations and at the same time we wish its people and Government, as they begin to enjoy the natural euphoria of freedom and the responsibility of an independent life, great success on the long road of progress and development.\\n215.\\tMr. President, your recognized qualities as a statesman and a diplomat experienced in international affairs convince us that the work of this session will be directed with all the skill required by the complexities of the problems we are going to discuss.\\n216.\\tWe should also like to pay a tribute to the outgoing President, the representative of a country which for many decades has given an example of a consistent policy in defence of international legality. We must recognize that Mr. Mojsov guaranteed the success of the thirty-second session of this Assembly.\\n217.\\tIt would be no more than simple justice to take advantage of our presence in this Assembly to draw attention to the tireless and skilful work of the Secretary- General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, who, by his consistent activity in the service of international peace and security and healthy co-operation among nations, has contributed undeniably to the strengthening of the credibility and effectiveness of our world Organization. Therefore we wish to offer to Mr. Waldheim all our support in his efforts to give concrete form to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and we reiterate our constant readiness to take part in joint action by nations in favour of the freedom, independence, development and the well- being of peoples.\\n218.\\tWe have just left a world in which a fierce struggle was necessary to gain recognition of the rights of peoples to be independent and to choose the ways they consider most suitable for their development.\\n219.\\tWe are the beneficiaries of this new legality which allows us to believe in the possibility of increasingly peaceful coexistence among countries at different levels of development and with different social structures. We are the beneficiaries of this struggle, which has been our struggle too for a very long time, since it can be asserted that our diplomatic history began, like that of Guinea- Bissau, at the moment when the PAIGC  began the struggle for the independence of our peoples. However, our struggle in fact was merely a concrete expression of the principles which have been reiterated year after year in this Assembly and which are embodied in all the fundamental documents of this Organization.\\n220.\\tWe believe that we have contributed by our efforts to the effective recognition of these principles, which constitute the basis of the international law of our time.\\n221.\\tThe geographical situation of my country, at the crossroad? of peoples and continents, constitutes one of its advantages. This position has always enabled Cape Verde to play an important role in bringing peoples together, which is perfectly in keeping with the guiding principles of our policy of non-alignment.\\n222.\\tThus we reaffirm that the Republic of Cape Verde will never shelter foreign military bases or serve as a liaison or support centre for aggressive operations against sovereign peoples and States.\\n223.\\tWe believe that peace, the necessary condition for development, will become a reality only when the rules established by all are implemented by all and guide the daily relations among nations. That is how we view our participation in the international community.\\n224.\\tThis Assembly, as in the past, continues to be a forum for repeated condemnation of attempts to perpetuate in Africa anachronistic situations marked by colonial and racist domination and apartheid. The praiseworthy and patient efforts of the international community, an echo of the liberation struggle of the peoples of Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa, which are reflected in the many resolutions of the United Nations condemning the minority regimes of southern Africa, have merely prompted the intensification of the terror inflicted on defenceless populations, the aggression against independent African States, the absolute lack of respect for and permanent defiance of the international community and the desire of the peoples of southern Africa for a life of dignity and peace. The indisputable evidence of this defiance of our world Organization is the recent decision of the South African Government to proceed unilaterally with a process leading to elections in Namibia which will inevitably be falsified, deliberately and dangerously disregarding the legitimate claims of the people of Namibia and its authentic representative, SWAPO, and flouting with barefaced arrogance every initiative aiming at a peaceful transition to independence.\\n225.\\tWe have always been convinced that the racist and apartheid regimes, since they are working against the tide of history, have never been ready to accept dialogue or to abandon the savage methods by which they trample underfoot the most fundamental human rights and resort systematically to violence against sovereign peoples and States, and this conviction has been reiterated year after year in this Assembly. Recent events persuade us that it is necessary and urgent that the international community multiply, diversify and centralize its efforts to assist SWAPO, the liberation movement fighting for the national independence and the territorial integrity of Namibia.\\n226.\\tThe people of Zimbabwe today are compelled to try to deal with a new farce: those who practise colonial oppression and defend apartheid have now taken up the banner of majority power and are claiming to lead the process for the transfer of power to the majority, oblivious of the freedom fighters united in the Patriotic Front. The kind of solution that neglects the profound aspirations of the people of Zimbabwe to genuine independence amounts to nothing but ad hoc concessions to the pressure brought to bear by the liberation struggle, which, we solemnly reaffirm, deserves our complete solidarity.\\n227.\\tIn 1975, when welcoming the independence of Mozambique and Angola, we welcomed at the same time the emergence of a different stage in the struggle of the people of southern Africa. The buffer States disappeared and were replaced by two independent countries, strengthened by the example they gave to others and determined not to accept the situation prevailing south of their borders.\\n228.\\tThe growing isolation of that bastion of colonialism—to which the efforts made in the United Nations have contributed significantly and were certainly consolidated by the decisions of the recent World Conference to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination and the heroic resistance of the people of South Africa, led by their liberation movements, are driving the regime to exasperation, and, becoming even more defiant, it is systematically committing aggression with impunity against neighbouring countries.\\n229.\\tWe pay a tribute to those true interpreters of noble objectives who presided over the creation of the highest international body. It is the duty of the international community throughout the International Anti-Apartheid Year and the\\' Decade for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination to try to find effective ways of further isolating the anachronistic Pretoria regime and wiping out the historic shame of apartheid. Experience shows that this requires the strengthening of the capacity for action of the liberation movements.\\n230.\\tIn keeping with our experience of the national liberation struggle and as a country recently liberated from colonial oppression after two long decades of political and armed struggle, we understand the true dimensions of the immeasurable suffering imposed on the people of the Western Sahara in its struggle for the liberation of that Territory, which is illegally occupied and divided. Our solidarity with the peoples struggling against all kinds of oppression and opposition to the exercise of their right to self-determination and independence in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) reinforces our conviction that the dispute between the Saharan people and those who occupy its national territory can be peacefully and justly resolved only by the effective exercise by that people of their right to determine their own destiny in sovereignty and freedom.\\n231.\\tIn the same way, we stand shoulder to shoulder with the peoples of East Timor who are fighting for the total realization of their desire for freedom and independence.\\n232.\\tIn the Middle East, a situation persists which defies the general feeling of the international community, which has been clearly, repeatedly and unambiguously expressed in this Assembly and in other bodies of our Organization. The persistence in a policy of aggression, occupation and expansion, accompanied by attempts to transform demographic, economic, cultural and religious structures of regions conquered by force, represents a flagrant violation of the principles of the United Nations and furthermore constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security.\\n233.\\tSince our country is one of the youngest Members of this great family of sovereign and independent nations, and since we received from the United Nations considerable support during our national liberation struggle and even after independence, we are accustomed to viewing the Organization as the main guarantor or\\' international legality and the defender of the just claims of peoples for a life of peace, justice and progress.\\n234.\\tAs stubborn defenders of the ideals of the United Nations, of the movements of the non-aligned countries and of the OAU, we note with great concern the acts of aggression committed against Lebanon and the frequent violations of its territorial integrity and sovereignty. All States of the region are entitled to live in peace, independence and security. But a just and lasting peace will never be achieved until Israel decides to withdraw completely from all the Arab territory which it has occupied since 1967 and until it recognizes the legitimate, permanent and inalienable national rights of the Palestinian people and agrees to the effective exercise of those rights, including the right to establish a national and independent State.\\n235.\\tWe should like to reaffirm our unstinting support of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the sole legitimate representative of that martyred people, and our conviction that a definitive solution of the problem of the Middle East cannot be found without the active participation of the freedom fighters of the Palestine Liberation Organization on a footing of equality with all other parties directly involved in the conflict. Meanwhile we are following with keen interest the continuing efforts that are being made to try to establish suitable conditions for negotiations which, while respecting the basic and inalienable claims of the Palestinian people, would point the way to a peaceful and just solution.\\n236.\\tAs we commemorate this year the thirtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we should like to take this opportunity to express our satisfaction at the positive role which the United Nations has played in the field of human rights. Indeed, the establishment of norms of international law in this connexion, the consecration of the right of peoples to self-determination and independence, and the initiatives taken in the field of the struggle against discrimination, racism, apartheid, torture and crimes against peace and humanity, as well as the special attention accorded to cases of the flagrant violation of human rights, are results of unquestionable importance to the credit of United Nations activity in this field, and it is a pleasure for me to emphasize them here.\\n237.\\tThe Republic of Cape Verde, the fruit of a genuine battle for human rights consisting in the long and hard political and armed struggle successfully carried out by PAIGC against Portuguese colonialism, can only rejoice at the visibly positive balance-sheet of the activities of our world Organization on behalf of human rights and freedoms.\\n238.\\tAfter independence a new administration was set up in our country based on broad popular participation, which is being restructured and consolidated and which is dedicated to guaranteeing to all citizens fundamental political and civil rights and freedoms. However, we feel that the struggle is continuing beyond the time of national independence, because the question of human rights cannot be dissociated from the economic, social and cultural context. Indeed, the effective, total and conscious exercise of civil and political rights is practically impossible without the establishment of certain basic economic, social and cultural conditions. There is consequently an essential interdependence of fundamental human rights which cannot be ignored.\\n239.\\tThe struggle for human rights is therefore in our country a process that is still continuing. Internally we are establishing the basis for economic development without which it would be impossible to free man from the spectre of hunger, poverty, disease, ignorance and illiteracy.\\n240.\\tOn the other hand, the question of human rights goes beyond the purely national sphere and is closely tied to certain questions of an international nature which are among the most important of our time. The effective exercise of human rights is not possible while the present international order persists and while colonialism, racism, apartheid and foreign domination and occupation prevail. However, the extension to the international level of problems of human rights must not make legitimate their use as a means of pressure, which might give rise to a climate of tension in relations between States.\\n241.\\tWe think that the United Nations should continue to play an important role in the promotion and safeguarding of human rights through the organs that it has set up, whose possibilities have not yet been exhausted and whose effectiveness has already been demonstrated on several occasions.\\n242.\\tWe should also like to express\\' our solidarity with those who deplore the incongruity of the fact that in a world where the spectre of hunger afflicts millions of human beings, nations continue year after year to spend enormous sums of money on the manufacture and stockpiling of arms. It is also to be deplored that an increasing part of the trade between nations is made up of the buying and selling of military equipment, while a large part of the population of the world remains without support in its struggle for the protection of the environment and the production of food and against ignorance, disease and natural disasters.\\n243.\\tThe continuance of a system where peace is merely the result of the permanent fear of reciprocal destruction cannot but contribute to increase tension in international relations and to divert States from their main task, which is to guarantee the well-being of their peoples. The need to put an end to the arms race and to initiate a procedure that will lead to real disarmament is felt very deeply by the whole of the international community. In this process at different regional levels great progress has been made, and laudable initiatives have been taken for the conclusion of agreements on the limitation of strategic weapons and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. In this process the United Nations, as the sole body capable of giving a universal dimension to the struggle for peace, security and development, should play an important role.\\n244.\\tThe fruitful results of this kind of thinking have already been confirmed by the tenth special session of the\\nGeneral.

       "['The statements delivered during this session’s general debate confirm that international relations are now being conducted in a complex and controversial period of history.\\nToday, we are all witnessing two opposing trends collide. On the one hand, we  see the strengthening    of polycentric principles of world order, the steady development of new centres of economic growth and peoples’ aspirations to preserve their sovereignty and choose development models that are consistent with their national, cultural and religious identities. On the other hand, we see the desire of a number of Western States to retain their self-proclaimed status as world leaders and slow the irreversible and objective process of establishing multipolarity. To that  end,  they  do not hesitate to use every possible method, including political blackmail, economic pressure and brute force.\\nSuch illegal actions  devalue the  international law that underpins the post-war world order. We hear statements trumpeted that not only call into question the legal validity of international treaties, but also prioritize self-serving unilateral approaches over decisions made within the United Nations. We are seeing an assault  by belligerent revisionism on the modern system of international law. There have been attacks on the basic principles of the Middle East peace process, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on the Iranian nuclear programme, commitments under the framework of  the World Trade Organization, the multilateral Paris Agreement on Climate Change and many more.\\nAt the same time, our Western colleagues continue to seek to replace the supremacy of law in world affairs with some kind of so-called rules-based order. Those\\n \\nrules themselves are invented depending on whatever is politically expedient and are a reflection of double standards. Baseless accusations of interference in the internal affairs of various countries are being made alongside overt attempts to undermine and topple democratically elected Governments. Efforts are being made to draw some countries into military alliances that are designed to further specific agendas against the will of the peoples of those countries, while other States are threatened with punishment for their free choice of partners and allies. It is telling that aggressive attacks on international institutions are being accompanied by attempts to privatize their secretariat structures and grant them the rights of intergovernmental bodies in the hope of manipulating them later.\\nThe shrinking space for constructive international cooperation, escalating confrontations, a growing overall lack of predictability, and a substantially higher risk of spontaneous conflicts all affect the work of this global Organization. The international  community has to pay a high price for the parochial, self-serving ambitions of a small group of countries. The collective mechanisms for responding to common security challenges have stalled. Diplomacy and a culture of negotiation and compromise are increasingly replaced by dictates and unilateral extraterritorial restrictions effected without the consent of the Security Council. Such measures, which have already been applied to dozens of countries, are ineffective as well as illegal, as demonstrated by the more  than  half-century  of the United States blockade of Cuba, which has been condemned by the entire international community.\\nOnce again, however, the lessons are not being drawn from history. The number of those who  want  to hand down verdicts without bothering with charges or trials is not getting any smaller. Today assumptions in the spirit of the notorious “highly likely” approach seem to provide sufficient grounds for some of our Western colleagues to make accusations against anyone they want to. We have already been through that, and we well remember how often spurious pretexts have been used to justify interventions and unleash wars, as was the case in Yugoslavia in 1999, Iraq in 2003 and Libya in 2011. The same methods are being used in Syria today. On 14 April, missile strikes were launched against Syria on a completely invented pretext, just hours before international inspectors were expected to arrive at the site of an incident that had been staged. This is a warning against any further provocations\\nby terrorists and their patrons involving the use of chemical weapons, which would be unacceptable.\\nThe conflict in Syria has already lasted seven years. The failed attempt to effect regime change, which was orchestrated from outside and relied on extremists, nearly resulted in the country’s disintegration and the emergence of a terrorist caliphate in its place. Russia’s energetic action, in response to the request of the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic and supported by diplomatic efforts in the context of the Astana process, helped prevent that devastating  scenario. The Syrian National Dialogue Congress, initiated by Russia, Iran and Turkey in Sochi in January, established the conditions for a political settlement in line with Security Council resolution 2254 (2015), and the basis for the intra-Syrian constitutional committee now being established in Geneva. Its agenda includes the restoration of ruined infrastructure in order to facilitate the return of millions of refugees to their homes. Assistance in addressing those issues in the interest of all Syrians, without double standards, must become a priority for international efforts and the activities of United Nations agencies.\\nDespite the complexity of the situation in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Libya, we  must  not  lose  sight  of the long-standing Palestinian question. A just and equitable solution to that issue is crucial to improving the situation throughout the Middle East. I want to warn against any unilateral  approaches  in  this area or attempts to monopolize this peace process. Today, as never before, the international community should consolidate its efforts with the aim of restarting talks on the basis of the relevant United Nations resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative. Russia will continue to do its utmost to facilitate the process, including within the Middle East Quartet and in cooperation with the League of Arab States and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. Mutually acceptable agreements must ensure the peaceful and safe coexistence of the two States of Israel and Palestine.\\nHere at the United Nations, which was created on the basis of lessons learned from the Second World War, we must all think about a future in which the repetition of past mistakes should have no place. This year marks the eightieth anniversary of the notorious Munich agreement crowning the criminal policy of appeasement of the Third Reich, a sad example of the catastrophic consequences that can result from national\\n \\negotism, disregard for international law and attempts to solve problems at others’ expense.\\nRegrettably, in a number of countries today not only has the vaccine against the Nazi plague been weakened, but a rising campaign to rewrite history and whitewash war criminals and their associates is  emerging.  In our view, the campaigns being waged in a number of countries to demolish monuments to the liberators of Europe are an outrage. We call on the Assembly to support the draft of this year’s versin of the annual resolution on the inadmissibility of glorification of the Nazis.\\nThe growth of radical nationalism and neo-fascism in Ukraine, where criminals who fought under Waffen- SS banners have been declared heroes, is one of the main factors in the protracted intra-Ukrainian conflict. The only way to settle that conflict is to ensure the comprehensive and consistent implementation in good faith of the Minsk package of measures, approved unanimously by the Security Council in its resolution 2202 (2015). We support the activities of the Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and are ready to provide its monitors with United Nations protection.\\nHowever, instead of implementing the Minsk agreements and engaging in dialogue with Donetsk and Luhansk, Kyiv continues to harbour the illusion that it may be able to put occupying forces in Donbas with the support of the West and is increasingly threatening to resort to military options. The sponsors of the current Kyiv authorities must bring their clients to their senses, make them lift the blockade of Donbas and end discrimination against ethnic minorities throughout Ukraine.\\nIn Kosovo, the international military presence authorized by the Security Council is being transformed into a United States military base, and Kosovo armed forces are being created. The agreements between Belgrade and Pristina brokered by the European Union are not being implemented. Russia calls on the parties to engage in dialogue in accordance with the principles of Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) and will support a decision that would be acceptable for Serbia. In general, we urge that the Balkans not be once again transformed into an arena for confrontation or declared to be someone’s particular patrimony. The peoples of the Balkans must not be forced to face a false choice,\\nand we must prevent new dividing lines from emerging in the region.\\nWe need to shape an architecture of equal and indivisible security elsewhere in the world, including the Asia-Pacific region. We welcome the positive developments on the Korean peninsula following the logic of the Russian-Chinese road map. It is important to encourage that process, which should be based on continuing the rapprochement between the  parties and on promoting the practical implementation of the important arrangements arrived at by Pyongyang and Seoul through the Security Council. We will continue to work to launch a multilateral process aimed at establishing a robust mechanism for peace and security in North-East Asia as soon as possible.\\nThe denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is among the tasks before the international community in the key security area of the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Regrettably, serious obstacles to that track continue to pile up. The unilateral withdrawal by the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, in violation of Security Council resolution 2231 (2015), and despite Iran’s full compliance with its obligations, came on top of the lack of progress in the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. We will do everything possible to preserve the deal approved by the Security Council.\\nWe are seeing increasingly negative  trends  in  the activities of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) whereby the West is attempting to transform the Technical Secretariat into an instrument for punishing undesirable Governments, which risks compromising the OPCW’s independent professional status, the universality of the Chemical Weapons Convention and the  exclusive  prerogatives of the Security Council. Those and other problems in the area of non-proliferation were discussed in detail in the Security Council on 26 September (see S/PV.8362), convened at a very timely moment by the United States presidency.\\nWe firmly believe that any problems or concerns that arise in international relations should be addressed through a substantive dialogue. If there are any bones of contention, we should come together around the negotiating table, engage in talks, present facts, heed\\n \\nthe our partners’ counterarguments and seek a balance of interests.\\nIn the past couple of years, the debate on abuses in cyberspace has become more intense. I would like to draw attention to the fact that it was Russia that initiated discussion of international information-security issues at the United Nations 20 years ago. Against the backdrop of recent developments, it is becoming ever more urgent that under the auspices of the United Nations we should develop global rules for the responsible behaviour of States in cyberspace, including the principles of the non-use of force, non-interference in internal affairs and respect for State sovereignty. We intend to introduce a draft resolution to that effect in the First Committee. We also believe that it is important to start work on a convention on cybercrime, and we envisage holding the relevant discussions in the Third Committee.\\nIt is more essential than ever to seek mutually acceptable agreements and the mutual consideration of interests in the areas of global trade and economic relations, which today are being subjected to an unprecedented degree of politicization. The values of free trade are being held hostage to trade wars and other forms of unfair competition.\\nRussia has consistently  promoted  a  philosophy of shared economic development,  as  enshrined  in  the Greater Eurasian Partnership initiative launched by President Vladimir Putin, a large-scale project open to all Asian and European States regardless of their membership in other integration associations. If consistently implemented, it could help to develop a the space for extensive economic cooperation in Eurasia. In the long term, it could lay the foundations for a renewed continental security architecture fit for the realities of the twenty-first century.\\nRussia will continue to do its utmost to build a world based on law, truth and justice, and we are not alone in that aspiration. Together with us, our allies and partners in the Collective Security Treaty Organization, the Eurasian Economic Community, the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) group and an overwhelming majority of other countries are advocating for the democratization of all aspects of international affairs and in the interests of all States, without exception. The West should also heed that voice, which is becoming\\nmore and more evident in the activities of the Group  of 20.\\nIn today’s turbulent circumstances, the growing relevance of the United Nations — the only existing forum for overcoming differences and coordinating the activities of the international community — is an objective reality. Cooperation, with a view to arriving at broadly acceptable solutions, was a priority built into the foundations of the United Nations from the very start. Today we must not fail to live up to the high goals and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and its dedication by the drafters to future generations.\\nWe should recall the art of negotiation in order to be worthy of their legacy. Many of today’s problems can be solved only on a basis of equality and mutual respect. Dictates and coercion, hallmarks of the era of colonialism, should once and for all be filed away in the archives or, better yet, consigned to the dustbin of history.\\nSome great statesmen of the past have bequeathed to us many words of wisdom that have come to be aphorisms. Let me quote just one, from President Harry Truman: “The responsibility of the great States is to serve and not to dominate the world”.\\nI hope that a culture of mutually respectful dialogue will finally prevail. Russia will do everything it can to achieve that.\\n']"

       "['I congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session, and I hope that the decisions and initiatives taken by the Assembly will play an effective role in resolving the problems that our world is currently facing.\\nFifteen years have passed since the painful terrorist attack in this city, a disaster whose human dimensions moved the entire world. On that day, no one imagined that this occurrence would lead to larger disasters or result in a devastating war in the Middle East and the spread of insecurity across the globe. This war has sown the seeds of borderless terrorism everywhere on Earth. Today, the most pressing question as to why we are facing such a situation should be on the agenda of every international forum. We need to find out which approaches, policies and erroneous actions have paved the way for the spread of insecurity throughout the world and what the world will look like 15 years from now.\\nSecurity has become a global problem at a time when major Powers are mainly focusing on advancing different methods of repression and military intervention under the pretext of creating a secure environment for their citizens. The genesis of borderless violent extremism and terrorism could be attributed to the security strategies developed by major Powers in the past 15 years. The main lesson to be learned from the analysis of this trend is that security in one region at the cost of insecurity in others is not only impossible, but it also leads to greater insecurity everywhere. Terrorists have even gone as far as claiming to have established States in the Levant, Iraq and Libya. More unfortunately, they hide their nefarious intents behind religious literature, thereby turning a compassionate religion into an instrument of violence and terror by spreading extremist and takfiri propaganda, which is all too regrettable.\\nThe century that began with terror and violence in New York should not continue with hostile competition and expanding conflicts in the Middle East. Today the discourse of hatred and violence in the Middle East and North Africa is spreading with astonishing speed. The region is caught in a web of the most savage and destructive of policies. Millions of Syrians are stranded in deserts or on high seas, and hundreds of thousands of them die a violent death. Iraqis of every ethnic group are concerned about their territorial integrity and the future of their homeland. The defenceless people of Yemen are subjected to daily aerial bombardments. Following decades of occupation and atrocities, Afghanistan has yet to be released from the grip of suffering, violence and terror. The oppressed Palestinians continue to be afflicted by the apartheid policies and atrocities set by the usurping Zionist regime.\\nUndoubtedly, if the region is to reverse the current dangerous trends and move towards development and stability, certain countries must stop bombing their neighbours and abandon their support for takfiri terrorist groups, while accepting responsibility and trying to compensate for past mistakes. If the Saudi Government is serious about its vision for development and regional security, it must cease and desist from the use of divisive policies, stop spreading hate ideology and refrain from trampling upon the rights of neighbours. It must accept its responsibility for the protection of the lives and dignity of pilgrims and construct relations with the nations in the region on the basis of mutual respect and accountability.\\nThe future of our region rests on dealing with fundamental challenges, including security crises. Due to inefficiency and lack of Government legitimacy, we will not be able to combat criminal and terrorist networks without genuine democracy or a participatory approach at national and transnational levels. We believe that countries in our region can create a shared future on the basis of their common history and culture and by isolating terrorist groups. We should never again allow our region to run the risk of dismemberment, given the impact of what took place close to a century ago.\\nIran’s principled approach calls for constructive partnership with our neighbours, with a view to establishing an enduring order based on shared security and efforts aimed at enhancing the developments of countries in the region and mutually beneficial economic cooperation. In order to uproot violence in the region there is no choice but to focus on promoting democracy, citizenship rights and economic development.\\nIran opposes any kind of sectarianism and any attempt to promote religious divisions. For centuries, the Muslim people, be they Shiites or Sunnis, have lived and continue to live together in harmony and mutual respect. Attempts to turn religious dissimilarities into tense confrontations are rooted in the vested interests of certain countries, which are trying to hide their quests for power behind religious slogans. Iran considers it imperative to preserve the territorial integrity of States, keep national borders intact, enhance people’s right to self-determination and uphold the principle of refraining from the threat or use of force. We also reiterate the need to use diplomacy in conflict resolution.\\nDespite today’s difficulties, I have hope in tomorrow. I have no doubt that we can prevail through prudence and wisdom. The experience acquired through dialogue between Iran and the P5+1 and the fruition of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) are indicative of the success that we could achieve through moderation, constructive interaction and the promotion of dialogue. A long, complicated and unnecessary crisis was brought to an end by the adoption of a win-win approach. The deal confirmed the peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme through the use of confidence-building mechanisms and entails the closure of the so-called possible military dimensions file and the reinstatement of Iran’s right to develop a peaceful nuclear programme.\\nThe deal also has put an end to unfounded concerns, leading to the removal of the brutal sanctions imposed against Iran. Beyond the nuclear file, however, the JCPOA holds important lessons the resolving complicated international problems. The deal is not only a political agreement; it also represents a creative approach and method for engaging in constructive interaction with a view to peacefully resolving crises and challenges. The lessons learned from the JCPOA will serve to improve international relations. We should never forget that these pressures, sanctions and illegal threats against the Iranian people, designed to fully dismantle Iran’s enrichment programme, were all defeated. Today, the Security Council and the International Atomic Energy Agency have formally accepted Iran’s peaceful nuclear programme.\\nThe United States is fully aware that the JCPOA constitutes a recognized multilateral agreement and that any failure on the part of the United States in implementing it would constitute an wrongful act under international law, to which the international community would object. Any failure in the implementation of the JCPOA will further erode the credibility of the United States around the world.\\nBreaches in compliance with the JCPOA by the United States in the past several months represents an error that should be rectified forthwith. Unfortunately, such illegal actions are not unprecedented. The latest example of this is the recent United States Supreme Court ruling which affirmed the legality of the seizure of billions of dollars in assets belonging to the Iranian people. This experience demonstrates that Zionist pressure groups could go so far as to persuade the United States Congress to pass indefensible legislation that forces the highest American judicial institution to violate peremptory norms of international law.\\nWith God’s help, the Iranian people’s fortitude and the increased participation of Iran’s partners from various regions around the world, and only eight months after the lifting of the cruel nuclear-related sanctions against my country, the economy of Iran, as the safest and most profitable destination for investment in our region, is showing clear improvement. Iran’s economic growth rate surpassed 4 per cent in the spring of 2016, the inflation rate dropped to single digits, and Iran has come close to pre-sanction levels of oil production and exports. All in all, we are seeing greater development in the economic, scientific and technological sectors of the country.\\nIran is one of the rare oil-producing countries that may be able to offset the shocking impact of the sharp slide in oil price in 2014. In order to attract investment, we are intent on strengthening economic stability and consistency through economic reforms and fiscal and financial discipline while preserving low rates of inflation. Economic growth is set to increase to around 5 per cent by the end of 2016. Based on all domestic and international predictions, Iran is currently enjoying one the highest growth rates among oil-producing countries.\\nIn conclusion, I would like to clearly state that it is my deep belief that, despite setbacks, moderation will prevail over extremism, peace will triumph over violence, enlightenment will overcome ignorance and, finally, justice will conquer injustice. What is important is that we channel our beliefs, hopes and efforts towards realizing peace and justice. If we do so, there is no doubt that the Almighty will assist all those who endeavour for peace, justice and moderation, and that God will help those who assist Him by defending his path, for the Lord is strong and mighty.\\n',\n",
       " 'I wish to congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson on his election as the President of the General Assembly at its seventy- first session. I believe that under his presidency, this session will make good progress on its agenda. I also wish to express appreciation for the effective work of Mr. Lykketoft, President of the General Assembly at its seventieth session. I also would like to pay tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who has with modesty and a drive for harmony and inclusiveness worked diligently and in a down-to-earth manner over the past decade and whose work has contributed significantly to world peace, sustainable development and the advancement and protection of human rights around the world.\\nIn 2015, the United Nations held a summit to consider the post-2015 development agenda and adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which has offered a new vision for global development. At the summit, China’s President Xi Jinping delivered a speech (see A/70/PV.7) entitled, “Towards win-win partnerships for sustainable development”, in which he expounded on China’s principles and positions. The year 2016 is the first year for the implementation of that Agenda.\\nThe general debate at the seventy-first session focuses on “The Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world”, a theme that could not be more relevant. On behalf of the Chinese Government, I would like to state today that China has taken action to advance the Agenda for Sustainable Development, and it has been one of the first States to submit its national plan on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda to the United Nations.\\nSustainable development concerns development first and foremost, and development underpins every human achievement. Without development, nothing is sustainable. The lack of development is often at the root of many of the world’s problems — poverty, the refugee crisis, war, conflicts or terrorism. All of these could be attributed to insufficient development, and none of them can be satisfactorily resolved without development. Only development can guarantee people’s fundamental rights and interests. Only development can root out the causes for global challenges. Only development can promote human civilization and progress.\\nOf course, development must be sustainable in all its dimensions. Otherwise, development, and especially growth, will stall. Growth will stall and be held back. Development cannot be sustainable if it is unbalanced and unequal and widens the gap between the North and the South, and between the rich and the poor. Development cannot be sustainable if it is expensive, if it is driven by high consumption with high pollution and high carbon emissions, or if it depletes resources and strains the environment. Development cannot be sustainable if economic growth and social progress are not well coordinated. Only when we have a profound understanding of the implications of sustainability, make progress in poverty reduction at all levels, engage in North-South and South-South cooperation, adapt to climate change, and promote equal sharing and green development can we ensure that development will hold its ground and be sustainable.\\nSustainable development must be inclusive and interconnected. Currently, the sustainable development endeavour is faced with great challenges. Regional conflicts and hotspots are without end. Traditional and non-traditional security threats intertwine, and the environment for sustainable development gives no reason for optimism. World economic recovery remains lukewarm, and globalization faces strong headwinds. The momentum for sustainable development is weak. There are frequent outbreaks of major infectious diseases and the eruption of natural disasters. Other issues to be faced are energy and resource security, food security and financial security. As those elements become intertwined, sustainable development necessarily faces an uphill battle. Such difficult moments call for greater confidence.\\nHumankind has the wisdom and the ability to find a way out. For that to happen, there must be cooperation and a spirit of working together to overcome difficulties. It is time that the international community assumes a new perspective, sees itself as a community with a shared future and interconnected interests and makes concerted efforts to tackle global challenges.\\nFor sustainable development to evolve, we must keep both short-term and long-term interests in mind while making concrete efforts to tackle challenges, actively transform and change our world, and achieve our new vision. We are ready to and must uphold the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Without peace and stability, there will be no sustainable development; even the development gains already attained risk being lost.\\nThe hard-won peace that has prevailed over the past 70 or more years testifies to the effectiveness of the international order and the norms of international relations based on the United Nations Charter. These norms and this order must be resolutely upheld since they not only serve the common interests of the people of all countries but also provide the most essential guarantee for achieving sustainable development.\\nAll countries need to observe and effectively implement the purposes and principles of the Charter, support the leading role of the United Nations and the Security Council in global affairs, and support the reform and improvement of global governance mechanisms to reflect the changes in the international, political and economic landscape. A new concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security should be nurtured. A global partnership that features dialogue instead of confrontation, and mutual, win-win benefits should be established.\\nWe must pursue political solutions to hotspot issues. Political solutions are the fundamental way out. History has repeatedly shown that to repress violence with force can only lead to more hatred and warfare from which no winner will emerge. Parties involved in conflicts must renounce a zero-sum mentality, settle disputes through dialogue, address differences through consultation and seek reconciliation with tolerance. The mediation efforts of the international community must be fair and impartial; they should facilitate the settlement of issues, not invite new problems.\\nOn Syria, we must remain committed to a political solution. The international community should encourage all relevant parties in Syria to end the fighting at an early date and reach a comprehensive political solution.\\nOn the Korean nuclear issue, we should remain committed to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, uphold peace and stability on the peninsula and seek consultation and dialogue so as to effectively maintain the international nuclear-non-proliferation regime.\\nTerrorism is the common enemy of humankind and must be combatted resolutely. At the same time, double standards should not be applied, nor should terrorism be linked with particular countries, races or religions.\\nWe must work together for the safe, steady recovery of the world economy, which cannot afford to maintain the long-term sluggishness we see now. Otherwise, sustainable development will be a fountain without a source. The current world economy is faced with both insufficient aggregate demand and prominent structural contradictions. We need to employ various kinds of effective policy instruments in a holistic manner, combine demand management with supply-side reform, and balance short-term policies with long-term ones.\\nWe call on all countries to make concerted efforts to drive the global economy along a road of strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth. Given their significant influence, major economies need to act responsibly in policymaking, particularly when coordinating macroeconomic policies. While focusing on their own growth, they also need to strive to reduce negative spillover and refrain from adding to the weakness of the global economic recovery.\\nEconomic globalization, represented by liberalization in and facilitation of trade and investment, has been a significant driving force behind rapid global growth in past decades, but it is no panacea to the ills of the world. Frankly, globalization has to some degree taken its toll on industries and communities in certain countries. Active measures need to be taken to address the problem, but it is always important to keep in mind the bigger picture, instead of focusing only on narrower interests.\\nGlobalization is consistent with the long-term and fundamental interests of all countries. It is the trend of the times. Countries need to firmly oppose protectionism in all its forms, resolutely uphold the free-trade regime represented by the World Trade Organization and promote sustained and sound economic growth for all countries through win-win and all-win cooperation. We must exert ourselves to address global challenges facing humankind. Greater attention and more support need to be given to Africa and the least developed countries to help them speed up industrialization, ensure food security and eliminate poverty and hunger so that more people can lead a life of decency and dignity.\\nMore needs to be done to create an international environment that helps reduce inequality and imbalance in global development. International institutions should spend their new resources on helping developing countries on a priority basis. Developed countries should make good on their official development assistance commitments, while developing countries need to pursue self-development and find paths suited to their national conditions.\\nAs we speak, the world is facing the largest refugee crisis since the Second World War. It is imperative to ensure refugee access to basic living conditions in order to stave off humanitarian crises. It is of fundamental importance to root out the causes of war and renew development so that countries of origin of refugees can embark on a path of enduring peace, development and prosperity.\\nCountries need to stay committed to the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities, equity and respective capabilities. They also need to jointly tackle climate change and work for the Paris Agreement to be universally accepted and take effect at an early date. Developed countries need to play a leading role, deliver on their emissions-reduction pledges and help developing countries improve their capacity to mitigate and adapt to climate change.\\nSince China adopted its reform and opening-up policy, the Chinese economy has maintained rapid growth, becoming the world’s second-largest economy in 2010. In 2014, China’s gross domestic product reached $10 trillion. In recent years, despite a greater basis of measurement for development, overall global complexity and long-accumulated underlying domestic issues, China has relied on reform and innovation to maintain a medium-high growth rate and promoted economic transformation and upgrading.\\nIn the first half of this year, our growth rate was 6.7 per cent, which was among the fastest in the major economies. Over 13 million new urban jobs are added annually. In other words, in the first eight months of this year, 9.5 million new urban jobs were created. Every percentage point of growth now equals several percentage points of growth in previous years, and the yearly economic increment is tantamount to the economic aggregate of a middle-income country. China’s effective management of its own affairs has been its greatest contribution to the world. Its contribution to global economic growth has been around 30 per cent.\\nHowever, we remain sober about our achievements and believe that China remains a developing country; there is still a long way to go before China achieves modernization. We will continue to give priority to development and pursue comprehensive social and economic growth, maintain a medium-high speed of economic growth and move to a medium-high level of development. China will continue to promote development through deepening reform.\\nReform has held the key to our previous achievements in development, and the same will hold true for the future. We will promote development through expanding our opening-up policy. China’s experience in past decades proves that a closed-door policy only leads to stagnation and backwardness, and it is opening up that brings development and prosperity. With a firm commitment to the win-win strategy of opening up, China will open its door even wider to the outside world.\\nChina will promote development by upholding peace. The prolonged sufferings of war have made the Chinese people cherish peace more than ever. As a dedicated follower of the path of peaceful development, China will pursue friendship and cooperation with all countries on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence. We uphold a mutual respect among all countries, regardless of their size.\\nChina also believes in working through dialogue, negotiation and friendly consultation to address various differences and issues, including disputes over territory and maritime rights and interests. We need to expand common ground, shelve differences and make continuous efforts for regional peace and stability.\\nChina has always worked for the peaceful settlement of hotspot issues. On the occasion of this year’s session of the General Assembly, China has clearly indicated that it will provide $300 million worth of humanitarian assistance to relevant countries and international organizations. Additionally, China will provide assistance on all fronts to the underdeveloped and least developed countries.\\nChina is a developing country with a population of 1.3 billion. We need to run our own affairs effectively while working to fulfil our due international responsibilities. By the end of 2015, China had contributed a total of over ¥400 billion to 166 countries and international and regional organizations and provided training in various sectors to over 12 million professionals from other developing countries. Going forward, China will strengthen cooperation with other developing countries and do whatever it can to help African countries and the least developing countries.\\nChina will only increase, not reduce, its support and assistance to other countries only as our economy grows. We stand ready to work with all countries to achieve common development and prosperity and to support sustainable development and international cooperation in relevant fields. By 2020, China will increase its total annual contributions to United Nations development agencies by $100 million over its 2015 contribution level. China is a country that backs its words with action. We will translate our commitments into real actions.\\nAchieving the goals for sustainable development is our shared task. Transforming our world and making it a better place is the common aspiration of all of us. China stands ready to work with other members of the international community, and make appropriate contributions to building a world free from want where development and dignity are ensured for all.\\n',\n",
       " 'Last year, from this same rostrum, at the seventieth anniversary session of the General Assembly, much was said concerning the critical turning point in world development. The keynote was the recognition that humankind is moving from a bipolar and monopolar world order towards multipolar and democratic systems of international relations with regard to dealing with common challenges and threats, which we can overcome only through joint efforts. It was rightly stressed that there is a need to change the very philosophy of inter-State communication by avoiding attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of States or to impose development models on countries and peoples.\\nUnfortunately, despite having acknowledged that fact, many Western countries continue to favour their entrenched ideas of mentoring, dominance, exclusiveness and the realization of self-interests by any means, rather than promote just and equitable cooperation. We see, in the bloodshed in the Middle East and North Africa, the consequences of such arrogance and their sense of infallibility in their pushing forward unilateral and reckless solutions to complex conflicts. As a result, the foundations of world stability are being destroyed. It is high time to draw the necessary lessons and avoid sinking into catastrophe in Syria.\\nLargely thanks to Russia’s military response and assistance at the request of the legitimate Government of Syria, it has been possible to prevent the collapse of that country’s statehood and the disintegration of the country under the onslaught of terrorists. Our involvement provided the impetus for the establishment of the International Syria Support Group, which seeks to start a meaningful political process so that the Syrians themselves can determine the future of their country through an inclusive dialogue among all ethnic and religious groups. That is uncontestable. It has been acknowledged in the relevant Security Council resolutions and is enshrined in the recent agreements between Russia and the United States as Co-Chairs of the International Syria Support Group. We thank everyone who has supported us in those efforts.\\nIt is now essential to prevent the collapse of those agreements and to carry out an unbiased and impartial investigation into the incidents in Deir ez-Zor and Aleppo, which undermine the agreements, especially given that there are quite a few people wishing to sabotage both the agreements and a settlement of the conflict in Syria. It is crucial to comply with the demand of the Security Council to separate what is known as the moderate opposition from the terrorists. And, in that regard, a particular responsibility lies with the United States and the members of the United States- led coalition.\\nIf we truly wish to resolve the Syrian crisis and the appalling humanitarian situation there, the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham, Jabhat al-Nusrah and associated extremist groups must be suppressed. That is key to reaching a cessation of hostilities and national reconciliation. Today, it is unpardonable to put off intra-Syrian negotiations, as well as to impose preconditions to them. Everything must be done in line with Security Council resolution 2254 (2015).\\nSabotaging the process — in particular through the use of external forces, including their advisers and supporters — has a negative impact on the reputation of the United Nations and leads us to believe that the reason for it lies in an attempt to change the regime. We have seen that sort of zero-sum game in Ukraine, which is very close to us, in the unconstitutional attempts to overthrow the Government and now in Ukraine’s refusal to fulfil the Minsk Agreement of 12 February 2015. By and large, the attempt to use those conflicts to achieve self-serving geopolitical goals has been obvious to everyone.\\nThe latest meeting of the International Syria Contact Group gives us reason to remain very cautiously optimistic. More broadly, it is only through the genuine implementation of all agreements that we will be able to have, in the Euro-Atlantic area, equal and indivisible security for mutually beneficial cooperation, as was stated at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe nearly 20 years ago.\\nNeither NATO nor the European Union will be able to replace a truly collective unification of efforts in the interest of all without losers and winners. And it is also utterly unacceptable to hold athletic competitions — which have always brought peoples together, strengthening friendship and mutual trust — hostage for reasons of political ambition. Attempts to manipulate the outcome of competitions does not honour those who flaunt their allegiance to fair competition but actually violate the General Assembly principles supporting the independence and autonomy of sports.\\nIn today’s world, we cannot be guided by the philosophy of the anti-heroes of George Orwell’s dystopic novel Animal Farm, where all animals are equal but some are more equal than others. In the enlightened twenty-first century, it is simply indecent to adopt the role of mentor to everyone else, reserving for oneself the right to use doping in sports, launch unilateral adventures bypassing the United Nations, conduct geopolitical experiments that cost millions of human lives, engage in the extraterritorial blackmail of everyone, including one’s closest allies, while what is really intended is to advance one’s own financial profit, or even to set the criteria for the greatness of a particular country. All of that is unworthy of the principles of freedom and equality, on the basis of which great nations have grown and which are now being used by their elites to threaten the entire world.\\nThis year, we mark the seventieth anniversary of the Nuremberg Tribunal decisions. The anniversary cautions us against forgetting the lessons of the Second World War and reminds us of the catastrophic consequences of attempting to determine the fate of the world by suppressing the legitimate interests of other States and peoples. The freedoms of expression and peaceful assembly should not be used as a cover for condoning radical movements that profess a Nazi ideology and support the glorification of the Nazis and their accomplices. The persistence of such vicious instincts dictates the need for consistent efforts to place a solid barrier in the way of neo-Nazism and revanchism, strengthen inter-ethnic and intercultural accord and rally the young generation around the ideas of justice and equality. We invite everyone to take part in the nineteenth World Festival of Youth and Students in Sochi in October 2017.\\nHegemony has no place in the future, if we want it to be a just future that gives people the opportunity to choose their own ways of development. That entails the need to learn to respect one’s partners and respect the cultural and civilizational diversity of the modern world. We must therefore return to our origins — the norms and principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter and other instruments of the world Organization. Our commitment to that approach was reaffirmed in the Declaration of the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China on the Promotion of International Law, signed on 25 June. The observance of the principles of the sovereign equality of States and non-interference in their internal affairs should become a measure of the decency and legitimacy of any member of the world community.\\nWe cannot address the global issues of countering international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and other transboundary threats without abandoning the philosophy of exclusiveness and permissiveness. There should be no place for double standards in fighting terrorism. Truly universal joint efforts are required to create a broad counter- terrorist front, as President Putin proposed from this rostrum last year (see A/70/PV.13). The tragedies in Iraq, Libya, Yemen and Syria have proved the need to stop opportunistic attempts to use extremists as a way to advance geopolitical intentions. Before it is too late, it is necessary to think about the task of preventing the proliferation of terrorist and extremist ideology, which literally holds youth hostage in various regions of the world. We are drafting a Security Council resolution aimed at mobilizing efforts to eliminate such evils. We are looking forward to support for our initiative.\\nThe elimination of the breeding grounds for radicalism would be facilitated significantly by resolving the conflict between Israel and Palestine. It is important to overcome the deep deadlock, which is stipulated in the 1 July 2016 report of the Quartet of Middle East facilitators. We call for the implementation of its recommendations.\\nWe are also seriously concerned about non-proliferation and arms control. There have been attempts to replace the key objectives of maintaining strategic stability in all its components with populist slogans of “nuclear zero”. We see a number of countries possessing nuclear arsenals not participating in the existing treaties. The fundamental Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is being put to a serious test. Its parties find it more difficult to speak a common language, especially in a situation when certain nuclear Powers torpedo any compromises regarding the start of the negotiations on the establishment of a zone free of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery in the Middle East.\\nRussia has consistently supported the liberation of humankind from the threat of nuclear weapons and other types of weapons of mass destruction. However, progress towards nuclear disarmament must be made in the context of the full consideration of a whole set of factors that affect strategic stability, including the impact of unilateral global missile defence systems, the development of strategic non-nuclear strike weapons, the threat of the placement of weapons in outer space, the inability to ensure the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, and the growing imbalance in conventional arms in Europe.\\nWe note the growing support for our initiative to draft an international convention for the suppression of acts of chemical and biological terrorism. The start of serious negotiations on that issue and on the Russia-China draft treaty on the prevention of the placement of weapons in outer space would help break the impasse in the key body of the United Nations multilateral disarmament architecture: the Conference on Disarmament. We call for substantial examination of our proposals to improve the Convention on Biological and Toxin Weapons.\\nNATO member countries brought conventional arms control in Europe to a deep deadlock. Our attempts to save it have faced a tough ideology-driven counteraction. All ideas to return to that issue would be meaningful only if NATO countries recognized the absolute futility of ultimatums aimed at achieving unilateral advantages. We continue to be open to an equitable and mutually respectful dialogue with NATO, including through the Collective Security Treaty Organization.\\nIt is necessary to work towards strengthening stability and equal and indivisible security in other parts of the world, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. The recent actions of North Korea, which violate Security Council resolutions, must be stopped. We call on Pyongyang to abandon its nuclear-missile programmes and return to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons regime. However, it is inadmissible to use that situation as a pretext for a massive militarization of North-East Asia and a deployment of another set of United States global missile-defence systems. All sides must refrain from the further escalation of tension and embark on the way toward a political and diplomatic settlement of the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula through the resumption of the talks.\\nWe will continue the dialogue within the framework of the East Asia Summits on the establishment of regional security and cooperation architecture in the Asia-Pacific region based on non-bloc foundations. A number of participating countries, including Russia, India, China and Indonesia, have submitted their views on that topic.\\nWe invite the countries of the region to agree on the ways to implement the initiative presented by President Putin to establish an extended Eurasia Partnership with the participation of the Eurasian Economic Union countries and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, as well as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and other interested States. I would like to underline that the aforementioned initiative is open and fully in line with the earlier plans to create a trade bloc between Russia and the European Union and is founded on the basis of World Trade Organization norms and principles, unlike other projects involving close trade blocs that undermine the unity of global trade systems.\\nWe will continue to promote the unification agenda in various international forums — the United Nations, the forum of the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa group, the SCO, and the Group of 20 (G-20). The recent summit in Hangzhou reaffirmed the status of the G-20 as a leading global economic and financial forum. We thank the Chinese chairmanship for its efforts to use that representative platform effectively for the exchange of views on the key issues of the global economy and on policies for the subsequent promotion of such agreements in the universal format of the United Nations.\\nThe signing of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change has become an important event among United Nations activities. The communication of nationally determined contributions on a voluntary basis moves us toward achieving the objectives of the Agreement, namely, to hold the increase in the average global temperature to below 2°C. Clear rules and procedures to implement the provisions of the Paris Agreement, bearing in mind the interests of all countries participating in the process, should be developed in order to achieve success.\\nIn that context, the launch of market and non-market mechanisms to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, as stipulated in article VI of the Agreement, is a priority matter. In the final analysis, that would be of crucial importance in preventing violations of the competitive environment and the transfer of polluting industries and dirty production from one country to another, which hampers the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\\nThe United Nations was established to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and develop equitable international cooperation. Today, that covers all areas of international life, including communication, political and military aspects of security, climate protection, conflict settlement, peacekeeping, ensuring human rights and freedoms, sustainable development, regulating information technology, and efforts to combat terrorism, drug- trafficking and corruption. Furthermore, it includes issues ranging from the eradication of infectious diseases to ensuring the social responsibility of businesses and fostering scientific and technological progress.\\nIn addition, of course, the United Nations must promote civil dialogue, thereby strengthening pluralism, cultures and traditions and serving as a catalyst for progress in science and the arts. In essence, we are talking about preserving humanity in all of its riches and diversity. That goal should constitute the basis for our collective efforts. It should become an imperative for global development and an incentive for improving global governance and the true democratization of international relations.\\nI would like to express our gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, who has made enormous efforts, in his position as Secretary-General, to renew the United Nations through timely actions. We believe that the new Secretary-General will also make a valuable contribution.\\n',\n",
       " 'I congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson on his election as President of the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. I am confident that his wisdom, leadership and experience will guide our session to success. Allow me also to thank Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, President at the seventieth session, for his important contributions to the work of the Assembly. My special gratitude extends to Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon for his leadership, commitment, tireless efforts and tremendous contributions during his ten years at the helm of the Organization.\\nLast year, 2015, we established a common vision for the world we live in. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction not only seek to address short-term challenges, but also to present a vision for greater partnership for people, the planet, peace and prosperity. The theme chosen for this session, “The Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to transform our world”, is therefore very opportune as we embark upon realizing our vision and turning our commitments into concrete results for our people.\\nI believe that achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is within our grasp. Our people, our children and grandchildren, expect us to deliver on our commitments. The implementation of the Millennium Development Goals has laid a solid foundation. Opportunities are plenty. Reform, innovation, creativity and economic restructuring are setting countries on a path to prosperity. The internationalization of production is making possible global and regional cooperation and integration for sustainable development. New advances in science and technology are paving the way for the fourth Industrial Revolution, which promises to bring humanity to a new, higher level of development.\\nBut challenges are by no means few. Developing countries in particular continue to suffer from the weak global economic recovery, rising protectionism in major economies, climate change, natural disasters and epidemics. Food and water security, the depletion of natural resources, and the humanitarian and migration crises also have negative and far-reaching implications for many countries and regions. Development and income gaps are widening at the national, regional and global levels. The instability and tension, violence, conflicts, terrorism and violent extremism that are plaguing many regions are of particular concern. Power politics and the use, or threat of use, of force in international relations continue to be a threat to international peace and security.\\nThat is the reality of our world today, and it compels us to work together to promote multilateralism and adherence to international law for peace, cooperation and sustainable development. As has been demonstrated, multilateral cooperation has a growing role to play in international relations. We are seeing multilateral institutions expand, both in numbers and in strength. Multi-tiered cooperation and integration are taking shape. Multilateral solutions to common challenges prove to be the most effective and long-lasting, since no country, large or small, rich or poor, can afford to address those challenges alone. Multilateral institutions are also venues for countries to promote their interests, effectively manage disputes and differences and expand their development opportunities.\\nThat is why Viet Nam believes that multilateralism must be strengthened and the operation of multilateral institutions, particularly the United Nations, must be improved. The United Nations has an indispensable role to play by coordinating international responses to global challenges and facilitating development cooperation. No other organization is better at fostering partnerships and assisting countries to successfully implement the SDGs.\\nAccordingly, to ensure greater equality, democracy and transparency, the United Nations, including the Security Council, must undergo reform. The United Nations development system must have better resources and be more effective and efficient. We must ensure the broadest participation of all countries in discussions and formulations of resolutions and decisions, so that no country will be left behind.\\nInternational law remains the linchpin of a stable international security architecture and a strong multilateral system. Unfortunately, the role of the fundamental norms and principles of international law is underestimated. Unfair demands, unilateralism, power politics and the use of force to address international security and political issues have been creating tensions and confrontation, hindering efforts to peacefully settle disputes and conflicts.\\nThis is where the United Nations can and must play a stronger part. The Organization must take the lead in promoting adherence to international law and the Charter of the United Nations as the foundation for international peace and security. No country, big or small, can be exempt from the law. The United Nations should also work to strengthen preventive diplomacy and the peaceful settlement of disputes, utilizing all tools, as provided in Article 33 of the Charter.\\nAbove all, I believe that each country should align its national interests with those of humankind and immerse itself in the community of nations. A policy of humanity, peace and friendship will enable us to eliminate hatred, narrow gaps, manage differences and open up opportunities to find lasting solutions to all disputes and conflicts. Having suffered from decades of war, Viet Nam treasures peace and will spare no effort to maintain or achieve peace. We believe lasting peace can be secured only by long-term vision and a comprehensive and inclusive approach that harmonizes\\n16-29811 19/52 the interests of all stakeholders. We welcome recent positive developments in the relations between Cuba and the United States and support resolutions on ending the economic embargo against Cuba.\\nMultilateralism, international law, peace, cooperation and development are the key elements for building a peaceful, stable and prosperous Asia- Pacific region. Regional countries are working to promote initiatives for political, economic, social and cultural cooperation and integration, including new- generation free trade areas. However, the Asia-Pacific region contains risks of conflict, especially on the Korean peninsula and in the South China Sea — all and any of which can threaten regional and international peace, security and prosperity. With regard to certain recent complicated developments in the South China Sea, we call upon all parties concerned to exercise self-restraint and solve disputes by peaceful means in accordance with international law, including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, fully respect diplomatic and legal processes, implement the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and expedite the completion of the code of conduct for the South China Sea.\\nViet Nam is strongly committed to the SDGs and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. A plan of action for the implementation of the SDGs has been developed, and we are working with United Nations agencies to craft the strategic plan 2017-2021, as part of the Delivering as One initiative, to assist Viet Nam in the implementation of the SDGs. For us, implementing the SDGs is part of and also encompasses our efforts to restructure the economy and transform the growth model, develop sustainable infrastructure, ensure social justice, address inequalities and protect the environment. As one of the countries predicted to be hardest hit by climate change and sea-level rise, Viet Nam is expediting procedures for the early ratification of the Paris Agreement and is planning its implementation.\\nExperience has shown that success comes only when we take our development into our own hands. To transform the world, we must start with transforming ourselves and leave no one behind. Viet Nam believes it essential to bring its domestic resources into full play and mainstream sustainability into our development vision, strategies and policies, with the people at the centre. We also believe that we can succeed only with stronger global partnerships, in which the United Nations plays the convening and coordinating role. Viet Nam calls on developed countries to uphold their responsibility to take the lead in assisting developing countries, including Viet Nam, to realize the SDGs, especially in financing, capacity-building, technology transfer and trade facilitation.\\nAs a peace-loving and friendly nation, Viet Nam always pursues the foreign policy of independence, self-reliance, peace, cooperation and development. We strive to be a friend, a reliable partner and a responsible member of the international community. Our commitment to multilateralism and international law is unwavering, and we will spare no effort to contribute to peace, cooperation and development.\\nViet Nam has decided to present its candidacy for non-permanent membership of the Security Council for the term 2020-2021 and will continue to increase its participation in the United Nations peacekeeping operations. Viet Nam looks forward to stronger partnership and collaboration with the United Nations and Member States to realize the vision of transforming our world and ensuring a better future.\\n']"

       "'Allow me to start by extending my congratulations to Ms. María Fernanda Espinosa Garcés and wishing much success to the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy- third session. Let me also assure her that, by working with Member States and the United Nations family, we look forward to advancing the seven priorities set out in the agenda of the General Assembly at its seventy- third session.\\nFrom this rostrum, I would like to provide the General Assembly with the latest regarding the situation in Afghanistan and the gains, opportunities and challenges that my nation faces at this critical juncture, in addition to our views on other key global challenges.\\nThe record of accomplishments by this institution over the past 73  years  demonstrates  that,  wherever it might be and whoever it might impact, we cannot escape the ripple effect of, or de-link ourselves from, the global, national, communal and human connections that bind  us, whether  in relation  to  the environment,\\n \\nthe climate, international finance or even the cyber and technology arenas. It is therefore critically important to go beyond just words, the duplication of effort or ineffective models that intermingle and, at times, spur countervailing or lopsided interests.\\nAs Albert Einstein once said, “We cannot solve our problems with the same level of thinking that created them”. Whether we are addressing hunger, acute poverty, climate change, overpopulation, terrorism, conflict, displacement, inequality or organized crime, we all share and own bits and pieces of  the problem in the same way that we collectively benefit or learn from the solutions. As a result, we need to explore  new means and identify new tools for reaching a wider consensus through more thoughtful dialogue and results-oriented actions.\\nTo this day we do not have a globally and officially acceptable definition for terrorism, a nefarious phenomenon used by a rogue or politically connected criminal, State or non-State actor using religious, ideological, economic or psychological cover to disrupt the status quo, upend the global and nation State order and reach a particular set of radical goals through the sheer use of indiscriminate violence that no religion in its undistorted form condones.\\nWhile we are determined to fight with vigour against newer versions of terror presenting themselves as remnants of Da’esh in a few pockets inside Afghanistan, we are still struggling to fully comprehend the role that terror breeding grounds, sanctuaries and funding pools, in many cases tied to criminal and illicit drug networks, play in the use and spread of terrorism. We are still trying to figure out how to render terrorism impotent as a policy tool used by some to further specific agendas.\\nFor example, for almost a quarter of a century, Afghanistan experienced the loss of tens of thousands of innocent lives and major infrastructural damage. It is partly due to geography and partly due to shortsighted strategies and regional agendas that have generated an umbilical reliance on non-State actors, used to keep others unstable through violence and  the  promotion of extremism. It has resulted in complacency and impunity; therefore, we need to do more and go beyond ineffective norms to bring about change and accountability. We have asked our neighbouring States, especially Pakistan, to help targeted societies, including their own, to deal with this menace. We are looking forward to the timely and effective implementation of\\nthe recently agreed Afghanistan-Pakistan Action Plan for Peace and Solidarity.\\nAll stakeholders need to agree to treat all shades of terrorism as one, shut down the breeding grounds and sanctuaries and prosecute or repatriate the violators. The response thus far has been sparse and insufficient. We are working with all countries, near and far, to bring about better results. On that basis, Afghanistan stands for the balanced implementation of all four pillars of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, and non-compliance must be seriously addressed as well. My country has also begun a process of structured cooperation with the United Nations Office of Counter- Terrorism, and we are supportive of regional initiatives through forums that focus on such priority concerns. We will continue to engage in work with regional stakeholders in that regard.\\nSince we last met, Afghanistan turned a page and made unprecedented overtures to the Taliban to be part of a credible, Afghan-owned, Afghan-led peace process that could lead to a just and comprehensive political settlement through talks and reconciliation. On several occasions, we have pledged our commitment to unconditional intra-Afghan dialogue and the restoration of all rights and privileges for those who agree to end the cycle of violence. We even announced a unilateral ceasefire earlier this year, which was agreed to by the Taliban for a three-day period and gave Afghans a glimpse of what peace can look and feel like. Unfortunately, extraneous agendas prevented us from replicating a second ceasefire more recently, but we will not rest. We will have to pursue both what is right and attainable.\\nI want to express my sincere thanks to all nations, especially the United States, other concerned nations and parties — including the Governments of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and of Indonesia, both of which recently hosted United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) gatherings — the United Nations and others for  encouraging all  sides to set the stage for a process that would lead to talks and a just and comprehensive negotiated settlement. Looking at the 25-year record, a prerequisite for talks is to learn from the history of peace engagement. We see that a dual approach is necessary to make sure that we win peace, but also protect and preserve our people’s gains and hard-earned achievements, which include constitutional order, freedom of expression, human and gender rights and creating economic opportunities.\\n \\nI want to pause here and pay tribute to Afghans who continue to suffer as a result of violence, as well as to our valiant National Security Forces for their steadfast defence of our nation and for standing tall and strong on the front line against terrorism.\\nThere are two important popular tests on the horizon  for  Afghanistan:  parliamentary  elections are slated for  next month and presidential elections for next year. Drawing on past experiences, both President Ashraf Ghani and I agree that political legitimacy is derived from the will of the people. While we pursue peace efforts and deal with security and governance challenges, we are reminded that, given our circumstances, eventually we must make sure that the electoral process is trustworthy and that the electorate can agree to a fairly credible and legitimate outcome. Regardless of who wins or loses, Afghanistan’s future rests on nurturing a national consensus that provides unity of purpose aimed at peace and political stability that derives legitimacy from foundations that are pluralistic, inclusive and democratic.\\nIn that regard, I wish to  thank  the  United Nations — UNAMA in particular — the European Union and all other contributors and donors for helping us move the process forward. Furthermore, we look forward to the upcoming Geneva ministerial conference on Afghanistan in November. It will be an excellent occasion to evaluate our work and the path ahead since we last met with donors.\\nOn the humanitarian front, Afghanistan also faces daunting tasks associated with an impending drought, refugee resettlement and internal displacement caused by climatic and national abnormalities, food insecurity and security threats. Those are estimated to impact two thirds of the country and the livelihoods of more than 4 million people, with the potential to force 1 million more into migration. We sorely need to attend to their humanitarian needs. I want to thank the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, other United Nations agencies, non-governmental organizations and donors for their contributions and hard work on the ground; however, we urge the international community to fully fund the 2018-2021 Afghanistan humanitarian response plan.\\nThe peaceful settlement of disputes and the protection of oppressed people are core principles of the Charter of the United Nations, benefiting the promotion\\nand preservation of international peace and security. As a war-ravaged country, we sympathize with and feel for the people of Syria, Yemen and other victimized communities around the world. Likewise, we stand for the basic right to protection for the Rohingya population in Myanmar. Afghanistan stands in  full support  of all United Nations and other international efforts aimed at achieving a just, comprehensive and lasting settlement to the question of Palestine, including the General Assembly’s call for an international protection mechanism for civilians.\\nMoreover, United Nations peacebuilding activities should provide due focus on the principle of national ownership, the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the promotion of greater coherence among the relevant United Nations entities and agencies working on development.\\nWith regard to the reform agenda, we stand in full support of efforts aimed at strengthening the role of the United Nations in the context of the Secretary-General’s initiatives. The establishment of the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs is a welcome move, as is the setting up of the Office of Counter- Terrorism. We look  forward  to  the  implementation of the resolution adopted on the repositioning of the United Nations development system and believe it will enhance our achievements in the establishment of One UN for Afghanistan.\\nAfghanistan’s active role within the United Nations system is currently more pronounced than ever. Our chairmanship of the Third Committee during the seventy- third session comes at a crucial time, as we have aimed to initiate and adopt several draft resolutions on shared themes, including victims of terrorism and the threat of improvised explosive devices, in addition to refugee and migrant issues, the rights of children, women’s empowerment, human rights, social development and other relevant Committee agenda items.\\nFurthermore, Afghanistan’s election to the Human Rights Council for the first time in 2017 marked our commitment and showcased our achievements in that regard. We remain party to major international protocols and conventions on human rights. I am pleased to inform the Assembly that Afghanistan recently passed a set of national laws on prohibiting cruel and degrading treatment, endorsed the law on prohibiting torture and combating human and migrant trafficking and adopted a code prohibiting child recruitment into our security\\n \\nforces. With regard to the latter, we are working closely with the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict.\\nI want to leave this rostrum by presenting a bold concept, also recently mentioned by President Ghani, that can form a new, visionary paradigm for my country and our region as we strive to end four decades of conflict and enter a new phase free of violence and the forced implementation of  stagnant ideas and spoiler habits. It is a  concept that dwells  on  Afghanistan becoming a platform of cordiality for regional and hemispheric cooperation over the next few years, in sharp contrast to being pushed and pulled towards becoming an area of instability and confrontation.\\nOur people, who pose no danger to anyone, are demanding a fundamental change in which they can play a constructive and collaborative role across boundaries and help turn their country into a roundabout of people, goods, services, communications, cooperation and ideas across the wider region. I believe that, with the help of the international community, we can turn this concept into a reality. I hope to further engage our regional partners in helping us bring this vision to fruition. I hope that the Assembly and all concerned Member States will play a supportive and positive role to put an end to years of agony and open up a new path leading to durable peace, stability and prosperity.\\n'"

       "['It is an honour to be present at the General Assembly today. It is wonderful to be here in the great city of New York. Once again this week, New Yorkers showed us how to be resilient and resolute in the face of violent extremism. On behalf of everyone in this Hall, let me directly say to the people of New York that they are a model to the rest of the world, and we thank them.\\nExactly one year ago, Canada was in the middle of a long — 78 days on the road, and I can assure the Assembly that, in Canada, there are 78 days’ worth of roads — and closely fought election campaign. It is the responsibility of a leader to spend time with the people they are elected to serve. To get the real stories, it is important to go where people live: coffee shops and church basements, mosques and synagogues, farmers’ markets and public parks. It was in those places that I got the best sense of what Canadians were thinking and how they were doing and, through the politeness — because we Canadians are always polite even when we are complaining — I learned a few things.\\nI talked with people my age who were trying to be hopeful about their future but found it tough to make ends meet, even when they were working full-time. I heard from young Canadians who were frustrated, who told me that they could not get a job because they do not have work experience but they cannot get work experience because they do not have a job. I heard from women and girls who still face inequality in the workplace and violence just because they are women, even in a progressive country like Canada.\\nI met parents who were working hard to give their children every opportunity to succeed but who feared that their efforts would not be sufficient. I had the chance share a meal with elderly retirees who had toiled all their lives but who now have to go to food banks. Over the past few years, I have had far too many disturbing conversations with Canadians, but they made something clear to me. Canadians still believe in progress, or, at least, that progress is possible. But that optimism is mixed with great concern. It is clear that Canadians are not the only ones who feel that way; those feelings are present everywhere. That anxiety is a fact of life.\\nWhen leaders are faced with citizens’ anxiety, we have a choice to make. Do we exploit that anxiety or do we allay it? Exploiting it is easy, but in order to allay it we need to be prepared to answer some very direct questions. What will create the good, well-paying jobs that people want and need and deserve? What will strengthen and grow the middle class and help those working hard to join it? What will build an economy that works for everyone? What will help to make the world a safer, more peaceful place?\\nTo allay people’s anxiety, we need to create economic growth that is broadly shared, because a fair and successful world is a peaceful one. We need to focus on what brings us together, not on what divides us. For Canada, that means re-engaging in global affairs through institutions like the United Nations. It does not serve our interests — or the world’s — to pretend that we are not deeply affected by what happens beyond our borders.\\nEarlier this year, we helped negotiate the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. As part of our commitment to implementing that Agreement, we announced that Canada would invest $2.65 billion over five years to fund clean, low-carbon growth in developing countries. In order to help promote peace and security in areas affected by instability, we reaffirmed our support for NATO and committed ourselves to expanding Canada’s role in United Nations peacekeeping operations. We hosted the fifth Replenishment Conference of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, where we increased our contribution by 20 per cent by giving more than $800 million to the Global Fund. We also encouraged our partners to increase their contributions, making it possible to raise $13 billion in support of ending AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria by 2030.\\nWe have done all this — and will do much more — because we believe we should confront anxiety with a clear plan to deal with its root causes. We believe we should bring people together around shared purposes such as the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. What is the alternative? Is it to exploit anxiety? Is it to turn it into fear and blame? Is it to reject others because they look or speak or pray differently than we do?\\nIn Canada we got a very important thing right — not perfect, but right. In Canada, we see diversity as a source of strength, not weakness. Our country is strong not in spite of our differences, but because of them. We must make no mistake: we have had many failures, from the internment of Ukrainian, Japanese and Italian Canadians during the World Wars, to our turning away of boats of Jewish and Punjabi refugees, to the shamefully continuing marginalization of indigenous peoples. What matters is that we learn from our mistakes and recommit ourselves to doing better. To that end, in recent months, Canadians have opened their hearts and their arms to families fleeing the ongoing conflict in Syria, and from the moment they arrived, those 31,000 refugees were welcomed — not as burdens, but as neighbours and friends — as new Canadians.\\nThat effort has brought Canadians together. In an almost unprecedented fashion, the Government has worked with the business community, engaged citizens and civil society to help the newcomers adapt to their new country. But our efforts will not truly be successful until those refugees have become established, full- fledged members of the Canadian middle class. I want the General Assembly to know that this objective is within our grasp — not because of what we have done, but because of what they are themselves.\\nRefugees are people with the same hopes and dreams as our own citizens. But while our people have felt anxiety, Syrians faced catastrophe. We all know where Syria’s middle class is: they are living in refugee camps in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. They are moving across Europe, looking for a place to set down roots, to get their kids back into school, to find steady work and to become productive citizens. Refugee camps are teeming with Syria’s middle class: doctors and lawyers, teachers and entrepreneurs. They are well educated. They work hard. They care about their families. They want a better life — a safer and more secure future for their kids — as we all do. When I say, therefore, that I hope that the Syrian refugees we welcomed will soon be able to join our middle class, I am confident that we can make that happen, and we will do it by offering to them the same things we offer to all our citizens — a real and fair chance at success for everyone.\\nWe are going to do all we can to build a strong middle class in Canada. We are going to invest in education, because it gives the next generation the tools they need to contribute to the world economy and to succeed. We are going to invest in infrastructure because it creates good, well-paying jobs for the middle class and helps to make our communities better places to live, work and invest. We are determined to build an economy that works for everyone — not just the wealthiest 1 per cent — so that every person benefits from economic growth. And we are going to refuse to give in to the pressure of trading our cherished values for easy votes. The world expects better from us, and we expect better from ourselves.\\nIn the end, there is a choice to be made. Strong, diverse, resilient countries like Canada did not happen by accident, and they will not continue without effort. Every single day, we need to choose hope over fear and diversity over division. Fear has never created a single job or fed a single family, and those who exploit it will never solve the problems that have created such anxiety. Our citizens, the nearly 7.5 billion people we collectively serve, are better than the cynics and pessimists think they are. People want their problems solved, not exploited.\\nCanada is a modest country. We know we cannot solve these problems alone. We know we need to do this all together. We know it will be hard work. But we are Canadian, and we are here to help.\\n',\n",
       " 'It is always an honour for me to address the General Assembly. It is also a responsibility — above all given the serious and worrying situation in the world. I stand before those present on behalf of France to issue several appeals. First, I would like to ask all members to do everything possible to implement the historic Agreement that was signed in Paris on 12 December 2015. The Agreement was historic because the conference was held at a time when Paris, the capital of France, had been struck by terrorist attacks. The Agreement was historic because, for the first time, the assembled international community agreed to make a commitment to reducing global warming and mobilizing financing, while allowing the most vulnerable countries to make an energy transition.\\nAnd yet, standing before the Assembly, let me state once again that despite the momentous nature of the Agreement, there is no time to lose. The past two years have been the hottest known to humankind since records began. Admittedly, in April 2016, right here with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, an agreement was signed with 175 countries. But everyone here knows that it will come into force only if it is ratified by 55 per cent of countries, representing 55 per cent of greenhouse-gas emissions. The United States and China have announced their decision to ratify, which is very important. Nothing would have been possible without the participation and the commitment of those two countries, which are the largest emitters of carbon dioxide. France itself will notify the United Nations tomorrow that it has completed its ratification procedure. I appeal to all members to speed up their ratification procedures so that the goal is met by the end of the year.\\nThe twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP-21) was a conference of decisions. The twenty-second session, to be held in Marrakech, should be a conference of solutions. It is a question of implementing the International Solar Alliance, fighting desertification, protecting the seas and also setting a carbon price.\\nHowever, the appeal I want to issue to the Assembly, following this climate agreement, is an appeal for Africa. Africa is a continent full of promise, but its development could be hindered by climate change, migration, conflict, war and terrorism. The continent has a bright future; however, it may also be the one to cause growing insecurity, and that insecurity targets, first and foremost, Africans themselves.\\nThat is why, on behalf of France, I am proposing a 2020 agenda for Africa. The plan should make it possible for all Africans to gain access to electricity. Two thirds of Africans today are deprived of it. That is an injustice, but above all it impedes sustainable growth in Africa. What is at stake, therefore, is responding to the needs of 15 per cent of the world population. What is at stake is enabling Africans to benefit from their immense potential for development. What is at issue here is reducing population displacements, that is, migration, which leads to the destabilization of both countries of origin and destination.\\nThat is why, at the Paris Conference, I launched the African Renewable Energy Initiative. Ten donors — and I want thank them here — pledged to donate $10 billion by 2020. France has assumed 20 per cent of that amount, or €2 billion. Europe has decided on an external investment plan, which could reach — still with a view to providing Africans with access to electricity — nearly €40 billion, and even double that amount if European Union member States contribute as well. I call on all countries to join that effort. I am not just calling for solidarity here — for this is a mutual investment that will benefit the whole world — I call for this to happen as soon as possible.\\nBut there will be no development in Africa unless the continent’s security is ensured. When I committed France to acting in Mali, it did so with an awareness of its responsibility. We had to prevent terrorist groups from taking over an entire country and destabilizing an entire region. Today, that threat has been rolled back and Mali is regaining its territorial integrity. But other groups, including Boko Haram and Al-Qaida, are emerging to threaten the security of many countries in West Africa, the Sahel and the Lake Chad region. There too, France is supporting military forces with training, information-sharing and assistance in the fight against terrorism. We are doing so, for instance, in the Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Benin and Cameroon. We should expand such efforts along with the United Nations and the African Union.\\nLet us be clear — the security of Africans has to come from Africans themselves if we want to avoid external intrusion and interference. My appeal for development and renewable energy is also a call for the security of Africans, for equipping their armies and giving them the means to respond, and for these African nations to organize their own development in a free and sovereign manner.\\nThe last call I wish to make here is perhaps the saddest of all. It is for Syria. The Syrian tragedy will go down in history as a disgrace for the international community if we do not end it quickly. Aleppo is today a martyred city, and this is how it shall remain in historical memory. Thousands of children have died in bombings, entire populations are starving, humanitarian convoys are being attacked, and chemical weapons are being used.\\nI have one thing to say in this regard — enough is enough. Just like in February, the ceasefire held for only a few days. It ended practically the day after its announcement, before its terms were even understood. The regime is responsible for its failure and cannot be exonerated for mistakes that could have been made by others. I would say to its foreign supporters — and we all know who they are — that they need to compel the regime’s hand to peace. If they do not then they, alongside the regime, shall bear responsibility for the division and chaos in Syria.\\nThe Security Council must meet as soon as possible. It should not be a theatre of fools — in other words, a place where responsibility can be evaded and where some can impede its work in order to protect a regime while they should be seeking a solution with us. France has four demands. First, we must first impose the ceasefire in line with the decisions that have been taken. That is the precondition. Secondly, we need to ensure the immediate delivery of humanitarian aid to Aleppo and other martyred cities. That is the priority. Thirdly, we must ensure the resumption of political negotiations along the lines of the transition established in 2012. That is the solution. Fourthly, we must sanction the use of chemical weapons. That is justice.\\nIf we take these decisions and act now, there will be a solution for Syria. In fact, it will be more than a solution; there will finally be hope for refugees and displaced persons. There will finally be action that will allow Syria to maintain its territorial integrity. We are also determined to see an intervention in Iraq that will help to free the entire country from the Da’esh occupation of its territory. If we decide to act effectively against terrorism, we can prevent further terrorist attacks around the world. The risk is chaos and division, and it exists beyond Syria. It also exists in Libya. Our priority must be to re-establish the State around the Government of National Accord led by Prime Minister Al-Sarraj — a goal for which France is working with its partners and the United Nations.\\nWe cannot sit back and do nothing. That would be playing into the hands of the forces, terrorists in particular, that aim to destabilize the world. France shall never resign itself, even if it is difficult — especially if it is difficult — and that is why it has taken the initiative to contribute to seeking a solution to the conflict between Israel and Palestine. Of course, no one can impose a solution on the parties, but once again, resigning ourselves to the status quo involves taking a risk. It means allowing settlement to take place once again. It means once again allowing unjust, unfair and unacceptable violence to take place. The objective, therefore, is to meet here at the end of the year and hold a conference at which Israelis and Palestinians can assume their responsibilities to negotiate.\\nThis same spirit led me, along with Chancellor Merkel, to seek a solution in Ukraine. It led to the creation of the Normandy format, which allowed us to come to an agreement in Minsk. Today, we must do everything we can to ensure that the agreement is implemented; if we do not, there will be renewed violence and perhaps even the resumption of war. I recall that this conflict has claimed more than 6,000 victims. I have therefore taken the initiative, along with the Chancellor of Germany, to bring together the Russian and Ukrainian Presidents in the weeks to come to promote progress in the implementation of the Minsk accords.We will not abandon that goal. We will renounce no initiative that we think may be useful.\\nI have raised the issue of terrorism, which threatens every country of the world. Long is the list of all those whom it has impacted in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Europe and even Oceania. No country can claim to be immune to the threat of Islamist terrorism, fundamentalism and fanaticism, which have seduced and radicalized lost individuals within our societies. There is no sea or wall that can protect a country from this tragedy and the scourge of terrorist action, attacks or aggressions. Terrorism thrives on open conflicts that have remained unsolved for too long. It has provoked a wave of refugees and undermined international order, borders that we thought fixed, law that we thought we could maintain and the collective security that was the very principle of the United Nations.\\nIn the face of these dangers, France once again turns to the United Nations. The United Nations has shown its effectiveness with the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which many thought was impossible. United Nations peacekeeping operations have never been as numerous as they are now.\\nHowever, if we want to act to eradicate terrorism, we will need to make decisions and not merely talk of solidarity when a friendly country is attacked or merely express compassion for the victims. We must shoulder responsibilities whenever that can be useful. That is what France does. Not because it is attacked — today, as I have said, every country is a target for terrorism. No, France does it because it is a permanent member of the Security Council and its role is about acting, not creating obstacles. France does it because it has one great idea, the idea that it has upheld throughout its history — bringing freedom, democracy and justice to the world. It is because France puts its policies at the service of a single goal — peace — and talks to everyone involved. It is because France is an independent nation that respects the law and has no enemies other than the forces of hatred and intolerance that use a betrayed religion to create fear. It is because we must fight the populists who exploit distress in order to divide, separate, stigmatize and pit religions against one another, risking confrontations that would have terrible consequences for cohesion in our societies. France is a secular country that proclaims itself as such but that speaks to every religion and guarantees freedom of worship on its soil, because the only interests we have in the world are stability, development and the future of our planet.\\nThat is why France is so committed to the United Nations and demonstrates it every day. I want to pay tribute to the President of the General Assembly, to all who dedicate themselves to the United Nations, beginning with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who for 10 years has led this difficult mission on behalf of all of us and enabled us to advance its cause. And that is also why, in the face of the major challenges I have mentioned, especially Syria and the fight against terrorism, I expect the United Nations, and particularly the Security Council, to shoulder its responsibilities. There comes a moment for every generation and public official when the only question worth asking is whether we have made decisions — and whether they are good decisions. The countries here are all different sizes, at different levels of development and with different sensitivities and beliefs, but they should have only one goal and one demand, which is that the world should rise to the challenges facing the planet.\\nThat is why I want to appeal to all those here — to call for implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, for ensuring that Africa and all Africans have electricity and better development, and for peace in Syria, because it is so urgently needed. That is why I believe in the United Nations, and that is why both France and I are sending a universal message.\\n',\n",
       " 'As I address the General Assembly in this Hall as President for the final time, let me recount the progress that we have made these last eight years. From the depths of the greatest financial crisis of our time, we coordinated our response to avoid further catastrophe and return the global economy to growth. We have taken away terrorist safe havens, strengthened the non-proliferation regime and resolved the Iranian nuclear issue through diplomacy. We opened relations with Cuba, helped Colombia end Latin America’s longest war, and we welcome a democratically elected leader of Myanmar to this Assembly. Our assistance is helping people feed themselves, care for the sick, power communities across Africa and promote models of development rather than dependence. We have made international institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund more representative, while establishing a framework to protect our planet from the ravages of climate change.\\nThis is important work. It has made a real difference in the lives of our people, and it could not have happened had we not worked together. Yet around the globe we are seeing the same forces of global integration that have made us interdependent also expose deep fault lines in the existing international order. We see it in the headlines every day. Around the world, refugees flow across borders in flight from brutal conflict. Financial disruptions continue to weigh upon our workers and entire communities. Across vast swaths of the Middle East, basic security and basic order have broken down. We see too many Governments muzzling journalists, quashing dissent and censoring the flow of information. Terrorist networks use social media to prey upon the minds of our youth, endangering open societies and spurring anger against innocent immigrants and Muslims. Powerful nations contest the constraints placed on them by international law.\\nThis is the paradox that defines our world today. A quarter century after the end of the Cold War, the world is by many measures less violent and more prosperous than ever before, and yet our societies are filled with uncertainty, unease and strife. Despite enormous progress, as people lose trust in institutions, governing becomes more difficult and tensions between nations become more quick to surface.\\nI therefore believe that at this moment we all face a choice. We can choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration, or we can retreat into a world sharply divided, and ultimately in conflict, along age-old lines of nation, tribe, race or religion. I want to suggest today that we must go forward and not backward. I believe that as imperfect as they are, the principles of open markets, accountable governance, democracy, human rights and international law that we have forged remain the firmest foundation for human progress in this century. I make this argument not based on theory or ideology, but on facts — facts that all too often we forget in the immediacy of current events.\\nThis is the most important fact: the integration of our global economy has made life better for billions of men, women and children. Over the last 25 years, the number of people living in extreme poverty has been cut from nearly 40 per cent of humanity to under 10 per cent. That is unprecedented, and it is not an abstraction. It means children have enough to eat; mothers do not die in childbirth.\\nMeanwhile, cracking the genetic code promises to cure diseases that have plagued us for centuries. The Internet can deliver the entirety of human knowledge to a young girl in a remote village on a single hand- held device. In medicine and manufacturing, in education and communications, we are experiencing a transformation of how human beings live on a scale that recalls the revolutions in agriculture and industry. As a result, a person born today is more likely to be healthy, live longer and have access to opportunity than at any time in human history. Moreover, the collapse of colonialism and communism has allowed more people than ever before to live with the freedom to choose their leaders. Despite the real and troubling areas where freedom appears to be in retreat, the fact remains that the number of democracies around the world has nearly doubled in the last 25 years.\\nIn remote corners of the world, citizens are demanding respect for the dignity of all people no matter their gender, race, religion, disability or sexual orientation, and those who deny others dignity are subject to public reproach. An explosion of social media has given ordinary people more ways to express themselves and has raised people’s expectations for those of us in power. Indeed, our international order has been so successful that we take it as a given that great Powers no longer fight world wars, that the end of the Cold War lifted the shadow of nuclear Armageddon, that the battlefields of Europe have been replaced by peaceful union and that China and India remain on a path of remarkable growth.\\nI say all this not to whitewash the challenges we face or to suggest complacency. Rather, I believe that we need to acknowledge these achievements in order to summon the confidence to carry this progress forward and to make sure that we do not abandon those very things that have delivered this progress. In order to move forward, however, we do have to acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction. All too often, those trumpeting the benefits of globalization have ignored inequality within and among nations, have ignored the enduring appeal of ethnic and sectarian identities, and have left international institutions ill-equipped, underfunded and underresourced for handling transnational challenges.\\nAs these real problems have been neglected, alternative visions of the world have pressed forward both in the wealthiest countries and in the poorest: religious fundamentalism, the politics of ethnicity or tribe or sect, aggressive nationalism, a crude populism — sometimes from the far left, but more often from the far right — which seeks to restore what they believe was a better, simpler age free of outside contamination.\\nWe cannot dismiss these visions. They are powerful. They reflect dissatisfaction among too many of our citizens. I do not believe those visions can deliver security or prosperity over the long term, but I do believe that these visions fail to recognize, at a very basic level, our common humanity. Moreover, I believe that the acceleration of travel, technology and telecommunications — together with a global economy that depends on a global supply chain — makes it ultimately self-defeating for those who seek to reverse this progress. Today, a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself.\\nThe answer cannot be a simple rejection of global integration. Instead, we must work together to make sure that the benefits of such integration are broadly shared and that the economic, political and cultural disruptions that are caused by integration are squarely addressed. This is not the place for a detailed policy blueprint, but let me offer in broad strokes those areas where I believe we must do better together.\\nIt starts with making the global economy work better for all people and not just for those at the top. While open markets and capitalism have raised standards of living around the globe, globalization, combined with rapid progress in technology, has also weakened the position of workers and their ability to secure a decent wage. In advanced economies like my own, unions have been undermined and many manufacturing jobs have disappeared. Often, those who benefit most from globalization have used their political power to further undermine the position of workers.\\nIn developing countries, labour organizations have often been suppressed, and the growth of the middle class has been held back by corruption and underinvestment. Mercantilist policies pursued by Governments with export-driven models threaten to undermine the consensus that underpins global trade. Meanwhile, global capital is too often unaccountable — nearly $8 trillion stashed away in tax havens, the shadow banking system that grows beyond the reach of effective oversight.\\nA world in which 1 per cent of humankind controls as much wealth as the other 99 per cent will never be stable. I understand that the gaps between rich and poor are not new, but just as the child in a slum today can see the skyscraper nearby, technology now allows any person with a smartphone to see how the most privileged among us live and the contrast between their own lives and others’. Expectations rise then — faster than Governments can deliver — and a pervasive sense of injustice undermines people’s faith in the system.\\nSo how do we fix this imbalance? We cannot unwind immigration any more than we can stuff technology back into a box. Nor can we look to failed models of the past. If we start resorting to trade wars, market- distorting subsidies, beggar-thy-neighbour policies and overreliance on natural resources instead of innovation, these approaches will make us poor collectively, and they are more likely to lead to conflict. The stark contrast between, say, the success of the Republic of Korea and the wasteland of North Korea shows that the central planned control of the economy is a dead end.\\nBut I do believe there is another path, one that fuels growth and innovation and offers the clearest route to individual opportunity and national success. It does not require succumbing to a soulless capitalism that benefits only the few, but rather recognizes that economies are more successful when we close the gap between rich and poor and growth is broadly based. That means respecting the rights of workers so that they can organize into independent unions and earn a living wage. It means investing in our people, their skills, their education, their capacity to take an idea and turn it into a business. It means strengthening the safety net that protects our people from hardship and allows them to take more risks to look for a new job or start a new venture.\\nThese are the policies that I pursued here in the United States and with clear results. American businesses have now created 15 million new jobs. After the recession, the top 1 per cent of Americans were capturing more than 90 per cent of income growth, but today that is down to roughly half. Last year, poverty in this country fell at the fastest rate in nearly 50 years. With further investment in infrastructure and early childhood education and basic research, I am confident that such progress will continue.\\nSo just as I pursued these measures here at home, so the United States has worked with many nations to curb the excesses of capitalism, not to punish wealth, but to prevent repeated crises that can destroy it. That is why we have worked with other nations to create higher and clearer standards for banking and taxation, because a society that asks less of oligarchs than of ordinary citizens will rot from within.\\nThat is why we have pushed for transparency and cooperation in rooting out corruption and tracking illicit dollars, because markets create more jobs when they are fuelled by hard work and not the capacity to extort and bribe. That is why we have worked to reach trade agreements that raise labour standards and raise environmental standards, as we have done with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, so that the benefits are more broadly shared.\\nJust as we benefit by combating inequality within our countries, so I believe advanced economies still need to do more to close the gap between rich and poor nations around the globe. This is difficult politically. It is difficult to spend on foreign assistance, but I do not believe this is charity. For a small fraction of what we spent on the war in Iraq, we could support institutions so that fragile States do not collapse in the first place and invest in emerging economies that become markets for our goods. It is not just the right thing to do; it is the smart thing to do.\\nThat is why we need to follow through on our efforts to combat climate change. If we do not act boldly, the bill that could come due will be mass migrations, cities submerged, nations displaced, food supplies decimated and conflicts borne of despair. The Paris Agreement on Climate Change gives us a framework to act, but only if we scale up our ambitions. There must be a sense of urgency about bringing the Agreement into force and helping poorer countries leapfrog destructive forms of energy.\\nFor the wealthiest countries, therefore, a green climate fund should be just the beginning. We need to invest in research and provide market incentives to develop new technologies and then make those technologies accessible and affordable for poor countries. Only then can we continue lifting all people up from poverty without condemning our children to a planet beyond their capacity to repair it.\\nWe therefore need new models for the global marketplace, models that are inclusive and sustainable. In the same way, we need models of governance that are inclusive and accountable to ordinary people. I recognize that not every country in this Hall is going to follow the same model of governance. I do not think that America can or should impose our system of government on other countries, but there appears to be a growing contest between authoritarianism and liberalism right now. I want everybody to understand, I am not neutral in that contest. I believe in a liberal political order, an order built not just through elections and representative government, but also through respect for human rights and civil society and independent judiciaries and the rule of law.\\nI know that some countries that now recognize the power of free markets still reject the model of free societies. Perhaps those of us who have been promoting democracy feel somewhat discouraged since the end of the cold war, because we have learned that liberal democracy will not just wash across the globe in a single wave. It turns out that building accountable institutions is hard work, the work of generations. The gains are often fragile. Sometimes we take one step forward and then two steps back. In countries held together by borders drawn by colonial Powers, with ethnic enclaves and tribal divisions, politics and elections can sometimes appear to be a zero-sum game.\\nSo, given the difficulty in forging true democracy in the face of these pressures, it is no surprise that some argue that the future favours the strong man, a top-down model, rather than strong democratic institutions. But I believe this thinking is wrong. I believe that the road of true democracy remains the better path. I believe that, in the twenty-first century, economies can only grow to a certain point until they need to open up, because entrepreneurs need to access information in order to invent, young people need a global education in order to thrive, independent media needs to check the abuses of power. Without this evolution, the expectations of people will ultimately not be met. Suppression and stagnation will set in. And history shows that strong men are then left with two paths: permanent crackdown, which sparks strife at home, or scapegoating enemies abroad, which can lead to war.\\nI will admit that my belief that Governments should serve the individual and not the other way around is shaped by America’s story. Our nation began with the promise of freedom that applied only to the few, but because of our democratic Constitution, because of our Bill of Rights, because of our ideals, ordinary people were able to organize and march and protest. And ultimately those ideals won out and opened doors for women, minorities and workers in ways that made our economy more productive and turned our diversity into a strength. It gave innovators the chance to transform every area of human endeavour. It made it possible for someone like me to be elected President of the United States.\\nSo, yes, my views are shaped by the specific experiences of America, but I do not think this story is unique to America. Look at the transformation that has taken place in countries as different as Japan, Chile, Indonesia and Botswana. The countries that have succeeded are ones in which people feel they have a stake. In Europe, the progress of those countries in the former Soviet bloc that embraced democracy stand in clear contrast to those that did not. After all, the people of Ukraine did not take to the streets because of some plot imposed from abroad. They took to the streets because their leadership was for sale and they had no recourse. They demanded change because they saw life get better for the people in the Baltics and in Poland, societies that were more liberal and democratic and open than their own.\\nSo those of us who believe in democracy need to speak out forcefully because both the facts and history, I believe, are on our side. That does not mean that democracies are not without flaws. It does mean that the cure for what ails our democracies is greater engagement by our citizens, not less. Yes, in America, there is too much money in politics, too much entrenched partisanship, too little participation by citizens, in part because of a patchwork of laws that makes it harder to vote.\\nIn Europe, a well-intentioned Brussels often became too isolated from the normal push-and-pull of national politics. Too often in capitals decision-makers have forgotten that democracy needs to be driven by civic engagement from the bottom up, not governance by experts from the top down. So these are real problems. As leaders of democratic Governments make the case for democracy abroad, we had better strive harder to set a better example at home.\\nMoreover, every country will organize its Government informed by centuries of history, the circumstances of geography and the deeply held beliefs of its people. So I recognize that a traditional society may value unity and cohesion more than a diverse country like my own, which was founded upon what at the time was a radical idea, the idea of the liberty of individual human beings endowed with certain God-given rights. But that does not mean that ordinary people in Asia or Africa or the Middle East somehow prefer arbitrary rule that denies them a voice in the decisions that can shape their lives. I believe that spirit is universal. If anyone doubts the universality of that desire, listen to the voices of young people everywhere who call out for freedom and dignity and the opportunity to control their own lives.\\nThis leads me to the third thing we need to do. We must reject any forms of fundamentalism or racism or belief in ethnic superiority that makes our traditional identities irreconcilable with modernity. Instead, we need to embrace the tolerance that results from respect for all human beings. It is a truism that global integration has led to a collision of cultures. Trade, migration, the Internet — all these things can challenge and unsettle our most cherished identities. We see liberal societies express opposition when women choose to cover themselves. We see protests responding to Western newspaper cartoons that caricature the Prophet Mohammed.\\nIn a world that left the age of empire behind, we see Russia attempting to recover lost glory through force. Asian powers debate competing claims of history. And in Europe and the United States, we see people wrestle with concerns about immigration and changing demographics, suggesting that somehow people who look different are corrupting the character of our countries. There is no easy answer for resolving all these social forces, and we must respect the meaning that people draw from their own traditions, from their religion, from their ethnicity, from their sense of nationhood. But I do not believe progress is possible if our desire to preserve our identities gives way to an impulse to dehumanize or dominate another group.\\nIf our religion leads us to persecute those of another faith, if we jail or beat people who are gay, if our traditions lead us to prevent girls from going to school, if we discriminate on the basis of race, tribe or ethnicity, then the fragile bonds of civilization will fray. The world is too small. We are too packed together for us to be able to resort to those old ways of thinking.\\nWe see this mindset in too many parts of the Middle East. So much of the collapse in order there has been fuelled because leaders sought legitimacy, not because of policies or programmes, but by resorting to persecuting political opposition, or demonizing other religious sects, by narrowing the public space to the mosque, where in too many places perversions of a great faith were tolerated. And these forces built up for years. They are now at work helping to fuel both Syria’s tragic civil war and the mindless medieval menace of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). The mindset of sectarianism, extremism, blood-letting and retribution that has been taking place will not be quickly reversed. If we are honest, we will understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long. But I do believe we have to be honest about the nature of these conflicts. Our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy. And there is a military component to that, which means being united and relentless in destroying networks like ISIL, which show no respect for human life. But it also means that in a place like Syria, where there is no ultimate military victory to be won, we are going to have to pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence, deliver aid to those in need, and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.\\nAcross the region’s conflicts, we have to insist that all parties recognize a common humanity and that nations end proxy wars that fuel disorder, because until basic questions are answered about how communities coexist, the embers of extremism will continue to burn, countless human beings will suffer — most of all in that region — and extremism will continue to be exported overseas. And the world is too small for us to simply be able to build a wall and prevent it from affecting our own societies.\\nAnd what is true in the Middle East is true for all of us. Surely religious traditions can be honoured and upheld while teaching young people science and math, rather than intolerance. Surely we can sustain our unique traditions while giving women their full and rightful role in the politics and economics of a nation. Surely we can rally our nations to solidarity while recognizing equal treatment for all communities — whether it is a religious minority in Myanmar or an ethnic minority in Burundi or a racial minority right here in the United States. And surely, Israelis and Palestinians will be better off if Palestinians reject incitement and recognize the legitimacy of Israel, and Israel recognizes that it cannot permanently occupy and settle Palestinian land. We all have to do better as leaders in tamping down, rather than encouraging, a notion of identity that leads us to diminish others.\\nAnd this leads me to the fourth and final thing we need to do, and that is sustain our commitment to international cooperation rooted in the rights and responsibilities of nations. As President of the United States, I know that for most of human history, power has not been unipolar. The end of the Cold War may have led too many to forget this truth. I have noticed as President that, at times, both America’s adversaries and some of our allies believe that all problems were either caused by Washington or could be solved by Washington, and perhaps too many in Washington believed that as well.\\nBut I believe that America has been a rare super- Power in human history insofar as it has been willing to think beyond narrow self-interest, that while we have made our share of mistakes over these last 25 years – and I have acknowledged some – we have strived, sometimes at great sacrifice, to align better our actions with our ideals. And as a consequence, I believe we have been a force for good.\\nWe have secured allies. We have acted to protect the vulnerable. We have supported human rights and welcomed scrutiny of our own actions. We have bound our power to international laws and institutions. When we have made mistakes, we have tried to acknowledge them. We have worked to roll back poverty, hunger and disease beyond our borders, not just within our borders.\\nI am proud of that. But I also know that we cannot do this alone. And I believe that if we are to meet the challenges of this century, we are all going to have to do more to build up international capacity. We cannot escape the prospect of nuclear war unless we all commit to stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and pursuing a world without them. When Iran agrees to accept constraints on its nuclear programme, that enhances global security and enhances Iran’s ability to work with other nations. On the other hand, when North Korea tests a bomb that endangers all of us. And any country that breaks this basic bargain must face consequences. And those nations with these weapons, like the United States, have a unique responsibility to pursue the path of reducing our stockpiles and reaffirming basic norms, like the commitment to never test them again.\\nWe cannot combat a disease like zika that recognizes no borders – mosquitos do not respect walls – unless we make permanent the same urgency that we brought to bear against Ebola – by strengthening our own systems of public health, by investing in cures, rolling back the root causes of disease and helping poorer countries develop their public health infrastructures.\\nWe can only eliminate extreme poverty if the Sustainable Development Goals that we have set are more than words on paper. Human ingenuity now gives us the capacity to feed the hungry and give all of our children – including our girls – the education that is the foundation for opportunity in our world. But we have to put our money where our mouths are. And we can only realize the promise of this institution’s founding – to replace the ravages of war with cooperation – if powerful nations like my own accept constraints. Sometimes I am criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions. But I am convinced that in the long run, giving up some freedom of action – not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests, but binding ourselves to international rules over the long term – enhances our security. And I think that is not true just for us.\\nIf Russia continues to interfere in the affairs of its neighbours, it may be popular at home and it may fuel nationalist fervour for a time, but over time it is also going to diminish its stature and make its borders less secure. In the South China Sea, a peaceful resolution of disputes offered by law will mean far greater stability than the militarization of a few rocks and reefs.\\nWe are all stakeholders in this international system, and it calls upon all of us to invest in the success of institutions to which we belong. And the good news is that many nations have shown what kind of progress is possible when we make those commitments. Consider what we have accomplished at the United Nations over the past few years. Together, we mobilized some 50,000 additional troops for United Nations peacekeeping, making them nimble, better equipped, better prepared to deal with emergencies. Together we established an Open Government Partnership so that, increasingly, transparency empowers more and more people around the globe. And together, now, we have to open our hearts and do more to help refugees who are desperate for a home.\\nWe should all welcome the pledges of increased assistance that have been made at this General Assembly gathering. I will be discussing that more this afternoon, but we have to follow through, even when the politics are hard, because, in the eyes of innocent men and women and children who, through no fault of their own, have had to flee everything that they know, everything that they love, we have to have the empathy to see ourselves. We have to imagine what it would be like for our family, for our children, if the unspeakable happened to us. And we should all understand that, ultimately, our world will be more secure if we are prepared to help those in need and the nations that are carrying the largest burden with respect to accommodating these refugees.\\nThere are a lot of nations right now that are doing the right thing, but many nations — particularly those blessed with wealth and the benefits of geography — that can do more to offer a hand, even if they also insist that refugees who come to our countries have to do more to adapt to the customs and conventions of the communities that are now providing them a home.\\nLet me conclude by saying that I recognize that history tells a different story than the one that I have talked about here today. There is a much darker and more cynical view of history that we can adopt. Human beings are too often motivated by greed and by power. Big countries for most of history have pushed smaller ones around. Tribes, ethnic groups and nation States have very often found it most convenient to define themselves by what they hate and not just those ideas that bind them together.\\nTime and again, human beings have believed that they finally arrived at a period of enlightenment only to then repeat cycles of conflict and suffering. Perhaps that is our fate. We have to remember that the choices of individual human beings led to repeated world war, but we also have to remember that the choices of individual human beings created the United Nations so that a war like that would never happen again. Each of us as leaders and each nation can choose to reject those who appeal to our worst impulses and embrace those who appeal to our best, for we have shown that we can choose a better history.\\nSitting in a prison cell, a young Martin Luther King, Jr., wrote:\\n“Human progress never rolls on the wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to be co-workers with God.”\\nAnd during the course of these eight years, as I have travelled to many nations represented here, I have seen that spirit in our young people, who are more educated and more tolerant, more inclusive, more diverse and more creative than our generation; who are more empathetic and compassionate towards their fellow human beings than previous generations. And, yes, some of that comes with the idealism of youth, but it also comes with young people’s access to information about other peoples and places — an understanding unique in human history that their future is bound with the fates of other human beings on the other side of the world.\\nI think of the thousands of health-care workers from around the world who volunteered to fight Ebola. I remember the young entrepreneurs I met who are now starting new businesses in Cuba, or the parliamentarians who used to be just a few years ago political prisoners in Myanmar. I think of the girls who have braved taunts or violence just to go to school in Afghanistan, and the university students who started programmes online to reject the extremism of organizations like ISIL. I draw strength from the young Americans — entrepreneurs, activists, soldiers, new citizens — who are remaking our nation once again, and who are unconstrained by old habits and old conventions and unencumbered by what is, but are instead ready to seize what ought to be.\\nMy own family is made up of the flesh and blood and traditions and cultures and faiths from a lot of different parts of the world — just as America has been built by immigrants from every shore. And in my own life in this country, and as President, I have learned that our identities do not have to be defined by putting someone else down, but can be enhanced by lifting somebody else up. They do not have to be defined in opposition to others, but rather by a belief in liberty and equality and justice and fairness.\\nAnd the embrace of these principles as universal does not weaken my particular pride in or my particular love for America — it strengthens it. My belief that these ideals apply everywhere does not lessen my commitment to helping those who look like me, or pray as I do, or pledge allegiance to my flag. But my faith in those principles does force me to expand my moral imagination and to recognize that I can best serve my own people and I can best look after my own daughters by making sure that my actions seek what is right for all people and all children, and other people’s daughters and sons.\\nThis is what I believe — that all of us can be co-workers with God. And our leadership, and our Governments, and the United Nations should reflect this irreducible truth.\\n',\n",
       " 'It is a great honour for me to address the General Assembly for the first time and to do so as Prime Minister of a country that has always been a proud and proactive member at the very heart of the United Nations.\\nThe United Nations was formed because leaders across the world knew that they could deliver security for their citizens at home only if they could cooperate as a community of nations to deliver security across the globe. Some of the threats that we face together today are familiar to those founding leaders: war, political instability, abuses of human rights and poverty. Others are new: global terrorism, climate change and unprecedented mass movements of people.\\nWe gather here today because we know that such challenges do not respect the borders of our individual nations and that only by working together shall we overcome them. As a new Prime Minister to the United Kingdom, my pledge to the United Nations is simple. The United Kingdom will be a confident, strong and dependable partner internationally, true to the universal values that we share together. We will continue to honour our commitment to spend 0.7 of our gross national income on development, building on the achievements that we have already made to reduce poverty, deal with instability and increase prosperity the world over, and we will drive forward the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.\\nWe will continue to champion the rights of women and girls, making sure that all girls get the education they deserve and tackling horrific abuses such as female genital mutilation and the use of sexual violence in conflict. We will continue to be a steadfast permanent member of the Security Council, meeting our NATO commitment to spend 2 per cent of gross domestic product on defence and making a leading contribution to United Nations peacekeeping efforts, where we have doubled our commitment, including new deployments to Somalia and South Sudan.\\nWe will continue to stand up for the rules-based international system and for international law, and I join other leaders in condemning the outrageous bombing of the aid convoy in Syria yesterday. We will continue to play our part in the international effort against climate change, and, in a demonstration of our commitment to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the United Kingdom will start its domestic procedures to enable ratification of the Paris Agreement and complete these before the end of the year. And we will continue to strengthen our existing partnerships, from the United Nations to the Commonwealth and to NATO, seeking to resolve conflict in countries across the world, from Colombia and Cyprus to Somalia and Yemen.\\nBut we must never forget that we stand here at the United Nations as servants of the men and women that we represent back at home. As we do so, we must recognize that for too many of these men and women, the increasing pace of globalization has left them feeling left behind. The challenge for those of us in this Hall is to ensure that our Governments and our global institutions such as the United Nations remain responsive to the people we serve, and that we are capable of adapting our institutions to the demands of the twenty-first century and of ensuring that they do not become irrelevant.\\nSo when it comes the big security and human rights challenges of our time, we need this, our United Nations, to forge a bold new multilateralism, because, as we have seen even in the past week, no country is untouched by the threat of global terrorism, and when extremists anywhere in the world can transmit their poisonous ideologies directly into the bedrooms of people vulnerable to radicalization, we need not just work together to prevent conflict and instability in nation States, but to act globally to disrupt the networks that terrorist groups use to finance operations and recruit to their ranks.\\nWhen we see the mass displacement of people on a scale unprecedented in recent history, we must ensure that we are implementing the policies that are fit for the challenges we face today. And when criminal gangs do not respect our national borders, trafficking our fellow citizens into lives of slavery and servitude, we cannot let those borders act as a barrier to bringing such criminals to justice.\\nIn each of these areas, it is the convening power of our United Nations that gives us a unique opportunity to respond. But we can do so only if we modernize and adapt to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.\\nAs a United Nations we have shown how we can work together to reduce the threat of international terrorism by preventing conflict and instability from developing. For example, as a permanent member of the Security Council, Britain has played a leading role in the fight against Al-Shabaab in Somalia. Since 2010, with huge support from across the region and, critically, the commitment of Somalis themselves, Al-Shabaab has been driven from all the major cities it used to control.\\nIt is vital that as an international community we continue to support countries in the region that are contributing thousands of troops, and that we continue to build the capacity of Somali security forces. That is why the United Kingdom is now going to increase further our security support, and we will be calling on others to do the same, hosting an international conference on Somalia in 2017, to maintain this vital momentum. Missions like this must remain central to the work of the United Nations, but on their own they are not enough, because the terrorist threats we face today do not come from one country but rather exist in a different space. The global networks they exploit require a different kind of global response.\\nThese organizations are using our own modern banking networks against us. We therefore need to look at our regulations and information-sharing and use our technological capabilities to get ahead of them. They are targeting our airlines, exploiting the fact that no one country can keep its citizens safe when they are flying between multiple jurisdictions. That is why this week the United Nations will vote on a United Kingdom- led draft resolution on aviation security so that every country implements the standards we need to ensure that no country is the weak link.\\nThey are exploiting the Internet and social media to spread an ideology that is recruiting people to their cause all over the world. We therefore need to tackle this ideology head-on. That is why the United Kingdom has championed the work that the Secretary-General has led to develop a strategy for preventing violent extremism. Now, as an international community, we must work together to adopt and implement the most comprehensive national action plans to tackle both the causes and the symptoms of all extremism. It is not enough merely to focus on violent extremism. We need to address the whole spectrum of extremism — violent extremism and non-violent extremism, Islamist and neo-Nazi, hate and fear in all their forms.\\nJust as we need the United Nations to modernize to meet the challenges of terrorism in the twenty-first century, so too must we adapt if we are to fashion a truly global response to the mass movements of people across the world and its implications for security and human rights. The 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol must remain the bedrock of our response, but the context in which they must be applied has dramatically changed.\\nAcross the world today, there are 65 million people who have been forcibly displaced. That is the equivalent of the entire population of the United Kingdom. It is an unprecedented figure, one that has almost doubled in a decade. And yet United Nations appeals are underfunded, host countries are not getting enough support and refugees are not getting the aid, education and economic opportunities they need. We must do more. As the second-largest bilateral provider of assistance, the United Kingdom remains fully committed to playing a leading role.\\nIn the past five years, the United Kingdom has invested over $9 billion in humanitarian assistance, saving millions of lives every year. The London Conference on Syria in February raised $12 billion in pledges, the largest amount ever raised in one day in response to a humanitarian crisis. And that money is being used to combine both urgent humanitarian assistance and vital economic development, benefiting both refugees and the communities and countries hosting them. Clearly, we need to continue our efforts to bring an end to the conflict and the appalling slaughter in Syria and to get aid through to those who need it.\\nWhile these efforts continue inside Syria, we also need new efforts to support refugees and host communities in neighbouring countries, including through education and opportunities to work. These efforts are complemented by loans from international financial institutions and access to European markets. Through our trading relationships and direct engagement with businesses, we are mobilizing the private sector to create new jobs in the region for everyone. While there is more to be done, it is this approach to financing both humanitarian support and economic development that I will be championing when I announce a further United Kingdom financial contribution at President Obama’s leaders’ summit on the global refugee crisis later today.\\nBut in addition to refugees and displaced people fleeing conflict and persecution, we are also seeing an unprecedented movement of people in search of greater economic opportunities through the same unmanaged channels. That affects all of us, and it is the responsibility of us all to take action. We cannot ignore the challenge or allow it to continue unmanaged. We need to do better — for the countries people leave, for the countries they move through, for the countries they try to get to — and most of all, better for the migrants and refugees themselves.\\nDespite the huge increase in international efforts, more migrants have died attempting hazardous journeys across borders this year than any other. I believe we have to use the opportunity afforded by this session of the General Assembly for an honest global debate to address this global challenge.\\nIn doing so, we should be clear that there is nothing wrong with the desire to migrate for a better life and that controlled, legal, safe, economic migration brings benefits to our economies. But countries have to be able to exercise control over their borders. The failure to do so erodes public confidence, fuels international crime, damages economies and reduces the resources for those who genuinely need protection and whose rights under the Refugee Convention should always be fulfilled. I believe there are three fundamental principles that we now need to establish at the heart of a new approach to managing migration that is in the interests of all those involved.\\nFirst of all, we must help ensure that refugees claim asylum in the first safe country they reach. The current trend of onward movements, where refugees reach a safe country but then press on with their journey, can only benefit criminal gangs and expose refugees to grave danger. We must therefore all do more to support countries where the refugees first arrive, to provide the necessary protection and assistance for refugees safely and swiftly and to help countries adapt to the huge economic impact that refugees can have — including on their existing population.\\nAs we are seeing in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, when the right assistance is provided, solutions that provide sanctuary and opportunity to refugees, and opportunities for those hosting them, can be found. This is also good for the refugees and the countries they come from — because the closer they stay to home, the easier it will be for them to return and rebuild after the conflict.\\nSecondly, we need to improve the ways we distinguish between refugees fleeing persecution and economic migrants. I believe we must ensure that the existing Convention and Protocol are properly applied to provide protection to refugees and reduce the incentives for economic migrants to use illegal routes. This in turn will help us target support for those refugees who need it most and retain the support of our populations for doing so.\\nThirdly, we need a better overall approach to managing economic migration — one that recognizes that all countries have the right to control their borders — and that we must all commit to accepting the return of our own nationals when they have no right to remain elsewhere. By ensuring a managed and controlled international migration response while simultaneously investing to tackle the underlying drivers of displacement and migration at source, we can reject isolationism and xenophobia, thereby achieving better outcomes for all of our citizens, particularly for the most vulnerable.\\nFinally, as we gather here today to bring the founding values of the United Nations to bear on some of the most pressing global problems, the likes of which we have never seen before, we must also face up to the fact that some of the worst human rights abuses, which we thought we had consigned to the history books, have re-emerged in new, pernicious forms. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, proclaimed by the General Assembly, stated that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, that no one should be held in slavery and servitude and that slavery and the slave trade should be prohibited in all their forms. Yet, nearly 70 years on, we are presented with a new form of slavery — modern slavery. Organized crime groups, which are largely behind this modern slavery, lure, dupe and force innocent men, women and children into extreme forms of exploitation. Trafficked and sold across borders, victims are forced into living the kind of inhumane existence that is almost too much for our imagination.\\nSuch criminals have global networks to help them make money out of some of the world’s most vulnerable people. Victims are held captive in squalid conditions, under the constant shadow of violence and forced into sex and labour exploitation. If we are going to succeed in stamping out this abhorrent crime and bring the perpetrators to justice, we need to confront the reality of what were are dealing with. These organized- crime groups work across borders and jurisdictions. They often use the Internet and modern technology to recruit, transport, control and exploit their victims, all the while staying ahead of legal systems that are often constrained by traditional geographical boundaries.\\nWe must therefore take action. We must use our international law-enforcement networks to track down these criminals wherever they are in the world and put them behind bars, where they belong. We need to be smarter and even more coordinated than the criminal gangs in our efforts to stop them. In the United Kingdom, I am setting up the first-ever Government task force for modern slavery, bringing together every relevant department to coordinate and drive all our efforts in the battle against this cruel exploitation. We are also using our aid budget to create a dedicated fund focused on high-risk countries where we know victims are regularly trafficked to the United Kingdom. Yesterday, I committed the first £5 million from that fund to work in Nigeria, to reduce the vulnerability of potential victims and step up the fight against those who seek to profit from this crime.\\nBut if we are to meet the Sustainable Development Goal to eradicate modern slavery, we need to go much further. Security relationships have developed between many countries for dealing with such issues as counter- terrorism, cybersecurity, drug trafficking and wider intelligence-sharing, but we do not have a similar relationship for the fight against modern slavery. We therefore need our law-enforcement agencies to work together, with joint investigation teams working across multiple countries. Victims will find freedom only if we cultivate a radically new, global and coordinated approach to defeating this vile crime. Together, we must work tirelessly to preserve the freedoms and values that have defined our United Nations from its inception. Together, we must work tirelessly to restore these freedoms and values to the lives of the men, women and children who are exploited for profit and held captive with little or no chance of escape.\\nFrom the Declaration of St. James’s Palace and the Atlantic Charter forged by Winston Churchill and President Roosevelt to the first meeting of the General Assembly in London in 1946, the United Kingdom has always been an outward-looking, global partner at the heart of international efforts to secure peace and prosperity for all our peoples. And that is how we will remain. For when the British people voted to leave the European Union, they did not vote to turn inwards or walk away from any of our partners in the world. Faced with challenges like migration, a desire for greater control of their country and a mounting sense that globalization is leaving working people behind, they demanded a politics that is more in touch with their concerns and bold action to address them.\\nBut that action must be more global, not less, because the biggest threats to our prosperity and security do not recognize or respect international borders. And if we focus only on what we do at home, the job is barely half done. This is not the time to turn away from our United Nations. It is the time to turn towards it. Only we, as members of this community of nations, can act to ensure that this great institution becomes as relevant for our future as it has been in our past.\\nLet us therefore come together, true to our founding values but responsive to the challenges of today, and let us work together to build a safer, more prosperous and more humane world for generations to come.\\n']"
